This article will talk about the 9 steps you can take to get rid of diabetes.\nWhat is Diabetes?\nDiabetes is a condition in which the body doesn't produce enough insulin or can't use the insulin it does produce properly.\nThere are two main types of diabetes: type 1 and type 2. Type 1 diabetes is usually caused by a virus, and usually affects children or young adults. Type 2 diabetes is usually caused by a combination of genes and lifestyle factors, and often affects middle-aged adults and older people.\nThere are several steps you can take to get rid of diabetes. First, you need to make sure your diet is healthy. You should eat foods that are low in sugar and calories, and include plenty of fruits and vegetables. Second, you need to exercise regularly. This will help to improve your blood sugar levels and reduce the risk of weight gain. Third, you need to monitor your blood sugar levels regularly using a blood glucose monitor or strips. If you have type 1 diabetes, you should also check your blood sugar level twice a day with an insulin pump. One of the best ways to reduce your risk of diabetes is to eat a healthy diet. This means avoiding sugary foods and refined grains, as well as limiting red meat, cheese and processed meats. Try to eat 2 or 3 servings of fruit and vegetables every day. As an added bonus, these foods contain vitamins that can work with insulin to help maintain your blood sugar levels.Low-fat dairy products can be a great source of calcium if you are lactose intolerant or if you choose not to drink milk or eat dairy products for other reasons. This means that nondairy sources such as soy milk, tofu or fortified cereals also provide calcium in your diet. All types of fish, including shellfish and sardines, are also rich\nType 1 and Type 2 Diabetes\nDiabetes is a condition that affects the way your body uses sugar. People with diabetes can have trouble using insulin to control their blood sugar levels.\nThere are a few different steps that you can take to help get rid of diabetes.

Fiber is important for maintaining bowel function and can also help to reduce the risk of heart disease and other health issues.\nAbout Diabetes: Type 1 diabetes mellitus is an autoimmune disease that occurs when the immune system destroys beta cells (cells involved in insulin production) in the pancreas The body does not produce enough insulin to control blood sugar levels, so lots of calories are absorbed into the blood stream despite the body's attempts to store as many carbohydrates as possible. To remedy this, the pancreas has to do more work than normal to produce enough insulin. When you cannot process food at a normal rate, one of the main things that is affected is your mood and emotional wellbeing. You will have to check with your doctor on dosage adjustments, but it is likely that they will be able to prescribe a medication which will help you keep glucose levels stable so that you can lead a full active life. Successfully managing diabetes is all about making sure your blood sugar levels stay within \"normal\" range and maintaining healthy eating habits. Losing weight is another factor which has to be kept in mind. The more fat you have in your body, the harder it will be for your body to process glucose in order to supply all the cells in your body with energy. This is something which cannot be ignored, and if you do not make changes to how you eat, you may find that it becomes difficult for your body to lose weight because there will not be enough energy available for it to burn properly. This can occur even when you are eating a healthy, balanced diet. Therefore, what you need is a balance between maintaining good blood sugar levels and keeping up with a healthy exercise routine, so that both are maintained.\nConclusion\nIf you are living with diabetes, then you know that it can be a frustrating and difficult disease to manage. Fortunately, there are steps that work for most people to get rid of diabetes. In this article, we will discuss the seven steps that have been shown to be effective in managing diabetes. If you follow these steps correctly, you should see a significant reduction in your blood sugar levels and an improvement in your overall health. So what are you waiting for? Take action today and start seeing real improvements in your diabetes management!",

I use blood sugar and blood glucose interchangeably below.\nType 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease which can only occur if you have an underlying genetic predisposition. Not all people who have the mutation will have it express itself. Some do without any obvious provocation, some with an illness like the flu and some who are subjected to PTSD type stresses develop Type 1. Mine was the latter. That is particularly rare.\nThere is no treatment, diet or exercise that will \u201ccure\u201d Type 1 diabetes. Once you\u2019ve got it you have it for life and your lifespan will be shortened. If you do well you may live longer than others who are less able to cope but you will live a shorter life. There is frequently sexual dysfunction as well.\nYour immune system attacks your pancreas which creates the beta/ islet cells that produce insulin. Insulin converts carbohydrates to food for your brain among other things. That\u2019s why when you have hypoglycemia (very low blood sugar) you become confused and have a hard time walking, talking, remembering that you have to eat or drink something that will provide glucose to your body. That is also why the police may think you are drunk rather than sick. If your glucose level continues to decline you will ultimately die.\nIf your glucose level climbs too high (your testing meter will only go to 600) you will become very thirsty (your body is trying to dilute and eliminate the glucose through urination.) You should give yourself insulin based on your personal ratios, which may be hard to determine at first. Mine are 1 unit for 15 grams of carbohydrates consumed and 1 unit for every 50 points I need to reduce my blood sugar. I think that\u2019s pretty normal. If you administer insulin and it does not go down call an ambulance while you still can. Keep in mind that everybody has different medical needs and circumstances.\nIf your glucose level gets extremely high you will start vomiting, sometimes projectile vomiting and eventually lose consciousness. Whether you survive or not depends on whether you are found and treated (Paramedics), generally with IV insulin or other methods of injecting insulin very quickly.\nBecause of two insulin pump failures in a month, I \u2019m now trying to relearn how to do it the old fashioned way, with a long acting insulin (Lantus) once a day and short acting ( Humalog) insulin for meals and corrections.\nThe Insulin Pump manufacturers have great lobbyists though. If you use a pump (Usually $5,000-$10,000, plus expensive monthly supplies) you can buy insulin at a steep discount. If you don\u2019t you have to pay a much higher price. And, of course, our insulin, like most drugs is 4\u20135 time higher than the cost in other countries. Our median wages are not 4\u20135 times higher though and 30 million people don\u2019t have health insurance.\nPeople are dying.",

This type of diabetes is relatively rare and only 10% of those affected by this disease are diagnosed with this type.\nType 1 diabetes is also sometimes called insulin-dependent diabetes or juvenile diabetes. This type of diabetes is prevalent in people under 40 years of age and even in adolescents and young adults.\nIf a person suffers from type 1 diabetes, that person will have to take insulin injections for the rest of their life, follow a specific diet and also monitor their blood glucose levels, taking blood tests periodically.\nHowever, type 2 diabetes is the most widespread in the population. About 90% of patients with diabetes suffer from this type. When a person suffers from type 2 diabetes, the body does not produce the necessary amounts of insulin or the cells of the body do not react to it, resulting in a condition known as insulin resistance.\nFor many people, type 2 diabetes is a relatively easy disease to control. One can control the symptoms of type 2 diabetes by maintaining weight within the recommended parameters, ensuring a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and monitoring blood glucose level regularly.",

High morning blood sugar may also be caused by insufficient insulin the night before, insufficient anti-diabetic medication dosages or carbohydrate snack consumption at bedtime.\nIf you have persistently elevated blood sugar in the morning, checking your blood sugar once during the night \u2014 around 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. \u2014 for several nights in a row will help you and your doctor determine if you have the dawn phenomenon or if there's another reason for an elevated morning blood sugar reading.\nWhat you can do\nYour doctor may recommend a number of options to help you prevent or correct high blood sugar levels in the morning:\nAvoid carbohydrates at bedtime.\nAdjust your dose of medication or insulin.\nSwitch to a different medication.\nChange the time when you take your medication or insulin from dinnertime to bedtime.\nUse an insulin pump to administer extra insulin during early-morning hours.\nOne should also manage diabetes effectively.\nEating Well To Effectively Manage Diabetes\nDiabetes or not, eating healthy food is recommended for everyone. However, if you have diabetes, you need to remember that eating healthy food is not just a requirement, but it should be part of your everyday life. Living with diabetes is hard. You need to drastically change the way you live your life especially when it comes to your diet.\nThere is basically no need to prepare separate meals for people with diabetes and for people who are not suffering from this disease as the diabetic diet is recommended for everyone. Healthy eating can be enjoyed by the whole family.\nHaving a healthy eating plan is recommended for all people suffering from diabetes. But, for people suffering from type 1 diabetes, special considerations should be taken. You have to remember that people with type 1 diabetes requires matching the amount of insulin they take to the carbohydrates in the food they eat.\nThis is why it is highly advisable for people with type 1 diabetes to consult a dietitian who is experienced in working with people with type 1 diabetes to help them prepare a healthy and suitable meal plan that they can work with.\nEating regularly is important for people suffering from diabetes. Instead of eating three large meals a day, it is important to spread it evenly throughout the day. Or, you have to have three meals a day and a snack after each meal.\nGenerally speaking, the diabetic diet should be low in fat, sugar, salt, and carbohydrates. Also, the diet should be high in vegetables, whole grains, and fruits.\nIf you regularly exercise, it is very important that you should match the amount of food you eat to the amount you burn each day. You shouldn\u2019t put too much fuel in your body that you won't burn. This is very important in order to get the right balance of blood glucose level in your body.\nIf you go out for a walk, always bring with you a snack bag. Always have something sweet with you, such as sodas, and hard candies. This will help you if you feel that you are experiencing hypoglycemia setting in.\nNever skip meals if you are diabetic. This will wreak havoc in your blood glucose levels and can result in potentially dangerous complications, such as hypoglycemia or low blood sugar levels. The worst thing that can happen to you if you skip meals and experience hypoglycemia is diabetic coma. This is one symptom that you don\u2019t want to experience and this is also a symptom that can be life threatening.\nAlcohol intake is possible if you are diabetic. But, try to limit it to one glass of wine a day or one bottle of beer a day. Also, try to have at least two alcohol-free days every week. If you are trying to lose weight, forget about beer. Instead, try whiskey as this doesn\u2019t contain any alcohol.\nAlso, it is best to drink alcoholic beverages with a meal or some food that contains carbohydrate.\nThese are the things that you have to remember as a diabetic. By following a strict diabetic diet, you can be sure that you will be able to properly and effectively manage diabetes. With these tips, living with diabetes will be a lot easier in your part.",

        "a_text": "That\u2019s a REALLY great question! I was diagnosed with Type II in Feb. of 2016. At first, I was terrified that I\u2019d be a HORRIBLE diabetic! I like sweets to much and was already quite over weight\u2026 (still am, but I\u2019m doing better about it.) So about three days after being diagnosed, I was sitting on the toilet and had ALL the terrible thoughts going through my head of the possible complications of uncontrolled diabetes. My grandmother was always referred to as a VERY brittle diabetic, which I now understand wasn\u2019t about how bad her diabetes was, but was instead about how little effort she put towards controlling it\u2026 Her diet was horrible! So anyway, I\u2019m sitting there with all these thoughts rolling through my head. Suddenly, I hit blindness. It was about the equivalent of hearing tires screeching on pavement trying to avoid an accident\u2026 and then the horrible gut wrenching sound of metal crunching. The thought of going blind crossed my mind. Not just going blind, but what that really meant, in a practical everyday kind of way. Not just having to walk with a cane or a seeing eye dog, not really even unable to read a book anymore, to see a Spring blossom, no. I had the unescapable thought of what it would be like to have to humble myself to the degree that I had to ask someone to come and look at my toilet paper to assure that I\u2019d wiped my butt clean after a bowel movement! In that instant collision of potential reality and understanding of who could best control that out come, I decided instantly that I could in fact, be a GREAT diabetic! Simply by watching my diet (carbs mostly) I brought my A1C down from 10.8% to 6.1% in 3 months. Then, in 2017, I had a short lapse of stupidity and stopped paying attention sufficiently, (my daughter introduced me to a new sweet pickle on the market and I went CRAZY eating pickle and cheese sandwiches!) I gained 20 lbs in one month. I literally went through, I think, 9 jars of pickles that month. But it might have been 12\u2026 I know right? DUH! My vision got kind of blurry one day, so I checked my blood sugar. It was almost 500! I went to the ED and got treated and was put on glipizide and actos. Fortunately, the pickles weren\u2019t overly well received and they quit carrying them. On one hand, I was kind of bummed, but on the other hand, it made it SO much easier! But it took several weeks for my vision to completely clear back up. It was bad enough that I was a little bit concerned about driving. Not because I couldn\u2019t see the other cars well enough, but because I was having trouble reading the road signs until I got right up on them. Fortunately, I was only driving in familiar territory, otherwise, I wouldn\u2019t have felt it safe to drive. Even now, I question whether it really was even then\u2026\nI think that diabetic complications are probably different for each of us and you just have to get to know your body and how it responds to things. We checked my A1C again about 3 weeks ago now. I was still on the glipizide, but had already been taken off the actos. The A1C came back at 4.9%. My doctor says he wishes he could farm me out to all his diabetic patients! I laughed at him and told him probably not\u2026 I don\u2019t always behave. I might not always be the poster child he had envisioned\u2026 Anyway, about two weeks ago I had to touch base with him because twice in one week I had my sugars dropped to the low to mid 40\u2019s. I think one was 43 and the other was 46. He immediately took me off the glipizide. So, now I\u2019m back to being totally diet controlled. Oh,\u2026 what I failed to mention was that the coming off of meds and the low A1C was due to the fact that I lost 15 lbs this summer. Just by walking. I have lung disease and am on high flow oxygen. Exercising is very difficult for me. But I moved into a new LARGE apartment building and have no choice BUT to walk\u2026 I take the dog out twice a day\u2026 That\u2019s ALL it\u2019s taken. But it\u2019s made a sufficient amount of difference that I\u2019m just about to the point now that I could choose to just go walk up and down the hall the length of the building to increase my exercise. I could do it indoors and have the climate control that I need and can\u2019t get when outdoors. I think that if you\u2019re having trouble with weight, one of the most important things to remember is that you didn\u2019t gain it quickly and you won\u2019t lose it quickly. Just stay the course, watch what you eat, both in content and proportion. Diet changes should not be a diet, but a lifestyle change that you can adopt for keeps.\nI know that this was kind of long and convoluted, for which I apologize, but if it can help anyone, it was certainly worth the time to me to type it out!",

        "a_text": "Diabetics often try to minimize their intake of white sugar, as well as snacks such as candy, cakes, and pies. However, other forms of sugar can also cause blood sugar spikes including brown sugar and \"natural\" sugars such as honey, agave nectar, and maple syrup.\nCandy is considered a snack that can help the mind become fresher so that it will certainly make us concentrate or think better. Unfortunately, according to health experts, diabetics should no longer eat candy to maintain their health condition. The sweet taste in candy is caused by the main ingredient of this snack which is granulated sugar. In fact, diabetics must really limit or even avoid sugar consumption in order to prevent complications.\nSo, is there no candy that is safe for consumption by diabetics? Health experts say that there are candy labeled sugar free or sugar free. Even though it still has a sweet taste, this candy gets it from natural ingredients such as ginger or mint. Because it does not contain sugar, diabetics can still consume it.\nBesides not consuming candy carelessly, health experts advise diabetics to pay attention to their daily sugar intake. Not only limiting their consumption, it's good they also replace the sugar used every day with low-calorie sugar. If you want to eat sweet foods, it's good for diabetics to eat sweet fruits such as bananas, apples, watermelons and papayas. Even so, it is better for them to consult a doctor first to ensure what foods are considered safe for their health conditions.\nHow to treat diabetes - Click Here To Read",

        "a_text": "Diabetes is a chronic disease that causes high blood sugar levels and abnormal insulin production. However, there are steps you can take to prevent the disease or at least reduce your risk for it. This article discusses how reducing stress, exercising, and following a diet can help you keep diabetes at bay.\nFive myths about diabetes\n1. Diabetes is a chronic disease that must be managed with medication indefinitely.\n2. People with diabetes can control their blood sugar levels by diet and exercise alone.\n3. The only way to prevent type 2 diabetes is to avoid eating foods high in sugar or carbohydrates.\n4. All people with diabetes should receive regular insulin injections to control their blood sugar levels.\n5. There is no cure for diabetes, but there are treatments that can help manage the disease.\nSteps to curing diabetes naturally\nIf you're looking to cure diabetes without medication, you may be pleased to know that there are a number of natural cures available. Here are four steps that can help you achieve this goal:\n1. Eat a balanced diet. This includes plenty of fruits and vegetables, as well as whole grains and low-fat proteins. You'll also want to avoid processed foods and sugary drinks.\n2. Exercise regularly. This is especially important if you have type 2 diabetes. Exercise helps to improve your blood sugar control by improving your overall fitness and reducing your risk of heart disease.\n3. Avoid stress levels. Stress can lead to increased blood sugar levels and other health problems, so try to minimize your exposure to stressors whenever possible. Yoga, meditation, aromatherapy, and other relaxation techniques can help you to manage stress more effectively.\n4. Seek professional help if necessary. If one step of this guide doesn't work for you, consider consulting with a medical professional. There may be other options available that are less restrictive than medication therapy , such as lifestyle changes or even dietary supplements that can help to control your blood sugar levels.\nRemember, this isn't the last step to take on your diabetes journey. In the end, it's all about finding what works best for you whether that is through a combination of medications or other alternative approaches and sticking to it!\nWhat foods to eat for a healthy diet.\nThere are many foods that can help to improve blood sugar levels and reduce the chances of developing diabetes. It is important to eat a variety of foods, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes. Here are some tips for eating a healthy diet:\n1. Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables. These foods are high in nutrients and can help to prevent diabetes complications. Include at least 2 servings of fruit or vegetables each day.\n2. Avoid sugary drinks and processed foods. These items can raise blood sugar levels quickly and lead to obesity and other health problems.\n3. Exercise regularly. Exercise can help to control blood sugar levels, lower cholesterol, and reduce the risk of heart disease. 30 minutes of moderate exercise every day is recommended.\n4. Monitor blood sugar levels regularly. If your blood sugar levels are consistently high or low, talk to your doctor about whether medication is necessary to manage the condition.\nHow do you cure diabetes naturally without medication?\nThere is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the best way to cure diabetes naturally will vary depending on your individual circumstances. However, there are a few general steps that can be taken to help improve your odds of success.\n1. Eat a balanced diet: One of the most important things you can do to cure diabetes naturally is to ensure that you are eating a healthy and nutritious diet. This includes making sure that you are including plenty of fruits and vegetables into your diet, as well as avoiding junk foods and excessive amounts of sugar. Consuming large amounts of sugar can lead to diabetes, as it spikes your blood sugar levels quickly.\n2. Exercise regularly: Not only is exercise one of the best ways to improve your overall health, but it is also beneficial for curing diabetes. Studies have shown that people who exercise regularly have a lower risk of developing diabetes than those who don\u2019t. If you are unable to exercise due to your condition, try to at least engage in some form of activity every day. Even simply walking around your neighborhood can help you stay healthy and reduce your risk of developing diabetes.\n3. Control your blood pressure: Another key factor in beating diabetes is to control your blood pressure. Blood pressure is the force that pushes blood through our veins and arteries. It affects how much fluid we can transport around in our bloodstream, and how well we feel. If we have high blood pressure, it can increase our risk of developing diabetes because it puts us at a greater risk for heart disease and other serious health problems.\n4. Limit your alcohol intake: Alcohol is one of the worst things you can consume on a daily basis if you are trying to beat diabetes. It will cause your blood sugar levels to spike immediately after drinking a glass of wine or beer. Your body gets to use up more glucose from food over time as well as from alcohol, but it will also leave you feeling fatigued. It is recommended that you avoid alcohol completely when you are trying to manage your diabetes, because it can cause problems with your blood sugar levels and may have other negative effects on your health.\n5. Control your weight: One of the best things you can do for yourself is to make sure you are maintaining a healthy weight. If you are carrying extra pounds, then this puts you at greater risk for developing diabetes as well as other serious health issues like heart disease, high blood pressure and stroke. It's important to keep a proper BMI (Body Mass Index) throughout life because diabetes can be hereditary, but if you don't lose any excess weight or gain too much weight, this won't happen to everyone. You should also consider eating healthy foods full of vitamins and vegetables, which will help you maintain a healthy weight.\n6. Stop smoking: Tobacco use is believed to be one of the most important risk factors for developing diabetes during middle age. The reason why this happens is because nicotine in cigarettes stimulates the body to produce more insulin, so if you smoke, your body reacts by producing even more insulin than usual. If you want to stop smoking, then it's an easy process that doesn't require too many changes in your lifestyle. You can do this by picking up a pack of breath mints or chewing gum after each cigarette or by trading down on cigarettes (lower tar and nicotine) when purchasing them.\n7. Take enough B vitamins: B vitamins are important nutrients that help keep blood sugar levels stable . The bottom line is that over time, too much of this vitamin can cause you to become diabetic. Consuming enough of this vitamin helps to manage blood sugar levels and keep you from developing diabetes. They're also very important for maintaining healthy skin and hair.\n8. If you are diagnosed with prediabetes or diabetes, then taking a B-complex supplement (such as TwinLab's Optimal B-100 HCL) or something like MyOmega Advanced Nutrition's MitoStat will help your body to maintain healthy blood sugar levels. You don't need to take only one type of B vitamin if you take more than one, so if each of them provides a different benefit then it may be better for you to try multiple types rather than just taking one version.\n9. Try taking a B-complex vitamin like Twinlab Optimal B-100 HCL, which contains all the essential B vitamins in one tablet and is designed for adults, as well as children and pregnant women. Not only does it contain all the essential B vitamins in a single tablet, it's also designed for adults, so you can take it without worrying about possible harmful side effects.\n10. To help maintain normal blood sugar levels while lowering your risk of diabetes, try taking a supplement that contains the trace mineral chromium picolinate. It's found naturally in some foods such as brewer's yeast and fruits such as bananas, but since many people aren't getting enough of this vital trace mineral when they're eating a traditional American diet, it's important to take a supplement. And that's what you'll find in the Chromium PICOLINATE by Pure Encapsulations. It contains chromium picolinate, which is derived from food sources such as brewer's yeast, or the root of the plant Allium sativum.\n11. To help support bone health and prevent osteoporosis in both men and women, try taking a supplement that contains magnesium glycinate instead of magnesium oxide (which is usually sold as Epsom salt). In addition to providing your body with magnesium, this form also provides it with amino acids like glycine and glutamic acid, so it can better absorb them for use throughout your body.\nThe benefits are many and include:\n1. Choline, a B vitamin that helps the liver break down fats into energy.\n2. Inositol, which converts tryptophan (an amino acid) into niacin and boosts levels of serotonin, dopamine and melatonin hormones in the brain.\nConclusion\nIf you are reading this article, it is likely that you are struggling with diabetes. Diabetes is a condition in which the body cannot properly use glucose, the most important type of sugar. If left untreated, diabetes can lead to serious health problems, including heart disease and blindness. There are many treatments available for diabetes but none of them are guaranteed to work for everyone. The best way to find out if a treatment is right for you is to try it. If your blood sugar levels stay high even after following a prescribed course of treatment, talk to your doctor about other options.",

It can also cause blindness, and can significantly increase the risk of you getting heart diseases, stroke and even birth defects. Amputations are also common in diabetics and it can significantly shorten the life expectancy by up t 15 years.\nIf you or someone you love is suffering from diabetes, then you have to know what you are up against in order for you to know how to live a normal life with the disease.\nAt first, you may be overwhelmed and get depressed upon knowing that you or someone you love has diabetes. You may even feel that this is a death sentence. But, you have to consider that you feel this because of your ignorance for the disease. Although diabetes still has no cure, you will see that there are ways on how you can properly manage it in order for you or for the person close to you who is affected with the disease live a more normal life.\nYou need to keep in mind that even with diabetes a person can still live a full life. All it takes is extra care and proper management of the disease. The first thing you need to remember about diabetes management is the diet. The diet plays an important role in the life of a diabetic. You will need to put together a meal plan with a dietitian as well as the doctor.\nIn most cases, you will find that diabetics will have several meals a day. Aside from breakfast, lunch and dinner, you will see that small snacks are required in between. The meals should be taken at the same time every single day in order to help keep the body on a schedule and also regulate the blood sugar levels in the body. Skipping meals and snacks may lead to large swings in blood sugar readings, which is a very dangerous thing for diabetics.\nIn order for the blood sugar level within normal range, a diabetic should balance the food they eat with the insulin that the body gets from exercising as well as from injections. You can monitor the blood sugar level with a device called glucose meter. This will be able to keep you informed on the current blood sugar levels in the body, which can be very helpful in planning meals.\nDiabetics should follow a certain meal plan as their body works differently from the person not suffering from diabetes. A diabetic should have low carbohydrate, low salt, low sugar, and high fiber diet. This will help regulate the blood sugar levels in the body and help prevent drastic changes in it.\nPreventing or minimizing complications is your goal when managing diabetes. By strictly following the proper diet and proper eating schedule, you can be sure that you will be able to live a normal and full life.",

According to American Diabetes Association, diabetes can go into remission Remission can be full or partial when managed effectively.\nHandy Hints That Will Help You Manage the Disease\nIf you have been recently diagnosed with diabetes, then you know how overwhelming the news can be. You will feel frustrated and you will also feel as if you have completely lost control of your life. This is a natural reaction from people being diagnosed with diabetes.\nLiving with diabetes is hard. Because this disease has no cure available yet, you can effectively manage it in order for you to live a more normal and full life. The key to treating diabetes is by effectively managing the blood sugar level. Also, you have to follow certain tips in order for you to make your life as a diabetic easier.\nThe first thing that you need to do in order to manage diabetes is by being knowledgeable about the disease. You can\u2019t fight what you don\u2019t know. So, by knowing the disease, you will be able to know how you can manage it and treat it.\nYou also need to eat regularly. You have to have three meals a day and also a snack after each meal. This will help regulate your blood sugar level and prevent you from experiencing hypoglycemia or low blood sugar level. Skipping meals can lead to unpleasant symptoms associated with hypoglycemia where the worst thing that can happen to you is going on a diabetic coma.\nIf you go somewhere, always carry something sweet with you. This will allow you to correct low blood sugar levels. An example of snacks would be fruit juice, raisins, soda, and hard sweets. These foods will be able to correct low blood sugar but all these things should be taken in small amounts.\nYou know that you are a diabetic but do other people know this? If you go somewhere where no one knows that you are diabetic, you should have something to tell them that you are in case you get involved in an accident or you experience going on a diabetic coma. Wear a medic alert bracelet that states that you are diabetic. This will inform people and medical professionals about your condition, which can potentially save your life.\nRegularly visiting your physician is also recommended. By doing so, your doctor will be able to regularly monitor your condition and help you manage diabetes. Always keep in mind that you shouldn\u2019t take any chances when it comes to your health.\nExercise is also very important if you are diabetic. You need to do regular but fairly moderate exercise. Try walking for 30 minutes every day. This will help regulate your blood sugar levels and also keep your heart healthy. In addition to this, you need to choose an exercise that is not hard on your feet. Getting cuts, blisters and foot infection can spell trouble. Go for gentle walking, swimming, or cycling. The last thing you want as a diabetic is getting your feet injured. If you do, you may become a perfect candidate for amputation.\nLastly, know the symptoms of blood sugar fluctuations. Watch out for excessive thirst, extreme hunger, sudden weight loss, frequent urination, moodiness, and nausea, gum and bladder infections. Blurred vision and itching and tingling sensations on the hands and feet are also signs that you should watch out for.\nThese are some of the handy hints that you should remember if you or someone you know is diabetic. By following these tips, you can be sure that managing diabetes will be easy.",

        "rating": "keep",
        "a_text": "The answer by Fosuza Mensah contains many inaccuracies\u2026\nDiabetic coma is ALWAYS due to a deficiency of insulin and part of the syndrome is ALWAYS an elevated blood sugar!\nThis is in COMPLETE CONTRADISTINCTION to hypoglycaemic coma that is due to too much insulin, either in absolute terms or in relation to having not eaten enough\u2026\nThe only similarity is that they are both potential complications of diabetes\u2026\nThe treatment of these two conditions is completely different and so is the clinical presentation\u2026\nDiabetic coma can be subdivided into two categories:\nDiabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a complication of Type I Diabetes mellitus; and\nHyperosmolar non-ketotic coma (HONK) is a complication of Type II Diabetes mellitus.\nBoth syndromes are, as already noted, due to a deficiency of insulin. However, for DKA to occur requires a pretty absolute deficiency of insulin because the cardinal biochemical marker of DKA is dramatically elevated ketone bodies. These ketone bodies are derivatives of free fatty acids usually stored in peripheral fatty tissue in the form of triglycerides. An enzyme found in this fatty tissue is hormone-dependent lipase. This enzyme\u2019s activity is usually completely suppressed by insulin and it takes essentially absent insulin levels to allow this enzyme to become active. Once this enzyme is allowed to become active then substantial amounts of triglycerides are liberated by the hydrolysis of triglycerides found in the peripheral fatty tissue. These triglycerides will circulate in the blood and are then taken up by the liver to produce ketone bodies. These ketone bodies can then be used by tissues instead of glucose as an energy source that are insulin-dependent and hence cannot use glucose as an energy substrate.\nIn DKA the reason for coma is not a lack of energy substrate. The CNS is not insulin-dependent tissue anyhow and so can access glucose in the absence of insulin. Instead, the metabolic holocaust induced by the lack of insulin causes a substantial metabolic acidosis (predominantly due to ketone bodies, but in severe cases also by a lactic acidosis), severe hyperkalaemia, hypomagnesaemia (often only unmasked once treatment is begun) that is a consequence of the polyuria that is induced by the hyperglycaemia, and dehydration, also a consequence of the polyuria and nausea and vomiting due to the ketoacidosis that, in addition to increasing fluid loss, also inhibits oral intake. All these together cause the coma that is characteristic of DKA. The whole syndrome usually takes hours to days to develop and often experienced diabetics (to their credit) recognize the problem and present early to hospital and so prevent a full-blown life-threatening event. The most common precipitants of DKA in Diabetics are, otherwise trivial, illnesses like a cold or influenza, or a self-limiting infectious gastroenteritis. Without treatment DKA is universally fatal! With treatment mortality is low but still finite!\nThe coma in HONK shares some similarities with DKA but there are also substantial differences as well\u2026\nIn Type II Diabetics the insulin deficiency is almost never extreme enough to allow the activation of hormone-sensitive lipase. Thus ketoacidosis is rarely a feature of HONK. However, the insulin deficiency is enough to precipitate a severe hyperglycaemia (levels are often much higher than one sees with DKA). The reason for this is that the syndrome develops at a slower rate than with DKA and so glucose levels in the blood have more time to rise. Dehydration is also often much more of a feature for the same reason. The dehydration is commonly severe enough to induce a shocked state and this, in turn, usually precipitates a severe lactic acidosis due to generalized tissue hypoperfusion. Electrolyte abnormalities induced by the lactic acidosis and prolonged period of polyuria are often more severe than those encountered in DKA\u2026 The overall metabolic chaos and its consequences in HONK result in a higher mortality than DKA in those who are treated appropriately. Untreated HONK is also universally fatal.\nThe coma in HONK is also due to the extreme dehydration and shock, as well as the severe electrolyte and acid-base abnormalities observed. The syndrome typically takes longer and develops slower than is the case with DKA. The mortality associated with HONK is often exacerbated by overzealous medical management where overdoing fluid replacement early and trying to normalize the blood sugar too quickly result in a cerebral oedema that can be fatal. (This is also a potential problem in children presenting with a DKA.)",

May be some thing helps.\nDiabetes is caused due to very low sugar intake or very high sugar intake. In both the cases the body loses its ability to digest sugar.\nMy mother is 82 year old. She is diabetic for last 40 years or more. She is on insulin and medicines for more than 30 years now.\nFor last 5 years or so, she need hospitalisation 3\u20134 times in a year due to high potassium and resultant complexities.\nAfter every hospitalisation she used to come back with blood sugar under reasonable limits. Within 30 days or so, her blood sugar levels will start increasing. With the rising blood sugar level, she used to get severe tooth ache. To manage her tooth ache she used to take pain killers. After few days of use of pain killers her blood sugar will become very high. Almost 450 to 550.\nIn one such emergency we called a doctor at house. Immediately on arrival he gave her a glass of sugar and water. I was shocked. We kept telling him that her blood sugar level is 450 and why should she be given sugar. He said that is the best thing that can be done at that time. No explanation.\nDuring her last hospitalisation I came to know that after admission in ICU she used to be given glucose for first 12 hours and lot of other medicines which had horrible side effects. During these first 12 hours her blood sugar used to go beyond 550\u2013600.\nDuring her last hospitalisation she developed gangrene. I had read 3 years back some where on internet that gangrene can be cured only by giving sugar.\nSo this time after coming from hospital I suggested her to start taking small doses of sugar (1/2 small spoon of sugar every 2 hours).\nWithin 3 months her gangrene healed.\nWithin 15 days her blood sugar came under control.\nShe did not get tooth ache in last 1 year.\nSince last 1 year there is no hospitalisation\nAfter 3 months of starting sugar intake she stopped taking insulin (her current level of insulin at that time was 24 units morning evening and 12 unit with lunch - Total around 55 units in 24 hours).\nAfter 6 months she started taking medicines on and off.\nIn all 3 strategies have been put in use over a period of time. This was based on her increase in confidence levels.\nSugar consumption - 1/2 small spoon every 2 hours. Once in a week for one day stop sugar consumption.\nWith sugar consumption I asked her to follow hydration / dehydration cycles. Check my blog for hydration / dehydration cycles.\nWalk 50 meters or so every 30 minutes. Besides these walks she was advised to take as much rest as she needed. Within 3\u20134 days of starting walking her terrible leg pains stopped completely.\nNow I will deal with some of other issues which are raised by people with professional medical degrees.\nPeople with diabetes need to drink more water since they urinate often\nFrequent urination is an indication of over hydration. You do not need any professional qualification to figure out this.\nI have helped a number of people with frequent urination and high thirst levels by hydration / dehydration cycles. Within 2 days of starting hydration / dehydration cycle the thirst disappears.\nThe funniest part is that after reducing the water intake from 5 liters a day to 1.5 liters a day the frequent urination and thirst are manageable.\nSo take charge of things. The situation is too bad out there in medicine sector.\nPeople with diabetes feel thirsty often\nThe thirst has nothing to do with hydration level of the individual. Thirst is an indication of excessive loss of minerals or extreme imbalance of the minerals in the body. Hydration / dehydration cycles take care of such imbalance of the minerals.\nI have helped a number of people with high thirst levels by hydration / dehydration cycles. Within 2 days of starting hydration / dehydration cycle the thirst disappears.\nI asked a question at Quora - The first life style change a person is asked to bring in himself is - walk a lot or exercise as much as one can do. Walking or exercising is dehydration. So why dehydration is not a first line of treatment of Diabetes? He replied that walking or exercising is not dehydration. Further he said that while walking a person is suggested to keep high levels of hydration. The people are desperate to mis-lead and mis-inform.\nIf exercise does not lead to dehydration, then why he is suggested to hydrate himself. May be simple things are too difficult to understand.

Type 1 diabetes complications can affect major organs. such as heart, blood vessels, nerves, eyes and kidneys. However, according to American Diabetes Association Diabetes can be managed effectively. Maintaining a normal blood sugar level can dramatically reduce the risk of many complications.\nDiabetes: What This Disease Can Affect\nTreating type 1 and type 2 diabetes today is a lot easier than in the past. Thanks to modern treatment methods and medicine, you will see that it is possible for diabetics to live a near normal life. However, living with diabetes is not always easy. You have to remember that this disease will not only affect your lifestyle but it will also have an impact on your relationships with other people, work, emotions, as well as your hobbies.\nDepressive illness like diabetes can get the sufferer to experience mood changes. It may be because of the unstable chemicals in your body that sends signals to your brain, or it may be because of the psychological and social impact that the disease have.\nBesides, you too would really be peeved at the simple fact that having diabetes will require you to change the way you live your life. Suddenly, you will need to take insulin injections, check your blood glucose level regularly, and also take care at what you need to eat or drink. Some people get depressed or angry because they feel that they lost control on how they live their life. Some people even get depressed as they need to give up certain hobbies.\nFamily life and relationships with other people may also get affected. For young people or teens, the normal conflict associated with adolescent or puberty within the family may be magnified with diabetes, which can also become a source in family strife.\nAdults too can have problems with relationships and family life if they are suffering from diabetes. It may be because of the lack of information on diabetes which can drive the concern of their partner.\nIt is important to remember that living with diabetes is far easier if a universal approach is taken. However, a compromise needs to be reached in order for the changes to fit in with the rest of the family. Some will need to make certain sacrifices in order to accommodate the management of the disease.\nDiabetes can also have an impact on work. If you have diabetes type 1, then professional diving, driving articulated vehicles, and flying airplanes is considered to be incompatible with the disease. However, you will see that most people really don\u2019t see diabetes affecting their ability to do their job. With proper management, someone with diabetes will still be able to work the same hours and work as hard as the person who doesn\u2019t have the illness.\nWhen it comes to driving vehicles, it is important to inform the DMV about your condition especially if you need to take tablets or injections to control your blood glucose level. The DMV will contact your physician and may ask about your case.\nAlso, informing the DMV about your condition will entitle you to insurance if you are involved in an accident where your diabetes is also involved in causing the accident.\nHaving diabetes doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t excel in sports. In fact, you can have diabetes and still win medals at the Olympics. This may sound a bit extreme but you have to remember that active lifestyle and diabetes are compatible. In fact, many physicians will recommend that you should go for an active lifestyle in order for you to have some sort of exercise, which can significantly help diabetes.\nPhysical activities can cause hypos in diabetics. In fact, people without diabetes can experience becoming hypoglycemic. To avoid this, adjust your diet and treatment in order to accommodate the physical activity that you do for recreation. It is also important that those around you should know about your condition and also know what to look for if you become hypoglycemic.\nDiabetes is a serious disease. There is no cure for it but as far as living a normal life, you will see that you will be able to do so with proper management and care. Living with diabetes may be hard for anyone suffering from the disease. But, with self discipline and knowledge about the disease, you can be sure that you will be able to live a full and near normal life.",

In diabetic individuals, however, this process becomes impaired.\n\u201cWe have shown that people with diabetes have abnormal blood flow regulation in the brain, namely impaired ability to increase blood flow and deliver sugar and oxygen to the brain during episodes of increased mental activity,\u201d the study\u2019s lead author, Dr. Vera Novak of the Harvard Medical School, told The Huffington Post in an email. \u201cInflammation further alters blood flow regulation in diabetic people and contributes to mental and functional decline.\u201d\nFor the study, the researchers recruited 65 men and women with an average age of 66, half of whom had Type 2 diabetes and half of whom did not. The participants were given a series of memory and cognition tests at the outset of the study and again two years later. They also received brain scans to measure brain volume and blood flow and blood tests to measure inflammation and blood sugar control.\nHere are some of the key findings:\n\u00b7 After two years, the people with diabetes showed greater declines in gray matter as well as impairments in their ability to regulate blood flow in the brain than the people without.\nBlood flow regulation decreased by an average of 65 percent in the participants with diabetes.\n\u00b7 Among participants with diabetes, scores on thinking and memory tests decreased by an average of 12 percent, from 46 to 41 points, while test scores of the participants without diabetes stayed the same at 55 percent.\n\u00b7 Higher levels of inflammation were correlated with greater difficulties with blood flow regulation.\n\u00b7 Those with the highest levels of blood flow regulation impairment at the outset of the study had more difficulties performing daily activities (such as cooking and bathing) after two years.\nThe study is the latest to observe a link between diabetes and cognitive decline.

A new trial by Novak\u2019s team is currently underway to determine whether injecting insulin into the brain might slow cognitive decline.\nBut for now, better detection and monitoring of blood flow regulation could help predict and manage cognitive challenges in people with diabetes.\n\u201cWorse performance on daily activities, worse memory or slower gait speed in older diabetic adults may hallmark a decline in ability to regulate blood flow in the brain,\u201d Novak told HuffPost. \u201cFor older diabetic people it is important to maintain healthy lifestyle and minimize fluctuations of blood sugar levels, in addition to their medication regimen.\u201d (Extracted from Huff.

DM is Diabetes Mellitus; \u201cdiabetes\u201d means siphon (relating to the symptoms of excessive thirst and urination), while \u201cmellitus\u201d means \u201choney-sweet\u201d, referring to the symptom of dark, sweet urine. All three types of DM involve an issue with either a lack of, or poor response to, the hormone insulin - the primary BG (Blood Glucose) lowering hormone (there are several more hormones involved in BG control).\nHow seriously a patient takes a diagnosis of DM is PURELY the individual\u2019s choice\u2026 ALL types of DM are deadly, and can cause some HORRIBLE \u201ccomplications\u201d long before death frees us from the disease. I know of NO healthcare provider that does not consider these diseases seriously. But many patients, in denial at time of diagnosis, do. To their own detriment.\nI\u2019ve been a T1 (Type 1 DM patient) for over 53 years - since I was 11 years old. I have ALWAYS taken it seriously, and have always \u201cfought\u201d to control my BG levels - which is the key to living a long, healthy life with any type of DM. T1 REQUIRES daily multiple injections of insulin (or a constant infusion drip of insulin) to stay alive - because our bodies make NONE, and without insulin - we DIE. That may make it easier to accept the seriousness of the disease - for many T2s, the initial symptoms may be mild enough to ignore; but for us T1s, they\u2019re not.\nBut ultimately - it\u2019s the PATIENT that must accept the fact they have a disease that REQUIRES treatment - regardless of how pronounced that treatment is - in order to live a long, healthy life with the disease.\nBUT\u2026 many of us CAN, and DO.",

        "a_text": "Abdul Muntakeem Piash asked: Why are diabetes patients increasing rapidly in the world?\nMy answer: Abdul, I am assuming you are asking about type 2 diabetes mellitus. T2DM is a metabolic disorder marked by increasing resistance of insulin receptors to accept insulin effectively blocking fuel (glucose) into the cells. This results in the insulin producing \u03b2 cells generating ever increasing amounts of insulin in an attempt to bring down high blood glucose levels.\nThe insulin receptors on on type cell seems less resistant fat cell. Insulin attaches and the fat cells grow. A fairly common symptom of T2DM is weight gain. Fat deposits especially in and around organs like the liver tend to increase insulin resistance.\nAnswering your question is a problem because at this time the actual root causes of T2DM is unknown. People have all kinds of answers that have limited validity but are not really on target. Here\u2019s some,\nLazy people get diabetes.\nEating sugar causes diabetes.\nFat people get diabetes.\nNone of these are on target. People with high insulin resistance will lack energy because their muscle cells are starving while being bathed in a sea of food. LIke the line from the Ancient Mariner, \u201cWater, water everywhere not a drop to drink\u201d It is not eating sugar that causes diabetes but the body not responding correctly to the rise of blood glucose. What is true is that T2DMs should avoid eating sugar including polysaccharides (starches) which are just long chains of glucose molecules. And number 3- people with insulin resistance tend to gain weight easily. While obesity aggravates the disorder it is not the cause.\nThere appears to be a genetic factor in developing type 2 diabetes mellitus. 20\u201330 years ago the risk factors were called the 4 Fs. Have 2 or 3 of these and your risk of developing diabetes increases. They are Fat, Forty, Family and Female. In the USA at least you can add a couple of ethnic groups that are more susceptible to T2DM, native peoples and those of sub Saharan African descent.\nNow we are coming to my opinionated hypothesis. Here goes:\nI suspect that the reason certain population groups are more prone to developing metabolic disorders is because they have evolved in environments where periodic famine is part of a the ordinary cycle of life. Some of these people have a set of genes that when triggered go into famine mode slowing metabolism and storing available energy against the coming bad times.\nThis idea of mine explains the four Fs including female as it is very important that the mothers and mothers to be survive. It also covers the ethnic groups who were in the near past living with a famine/feast cycle. The Plains Native Americans called spring early summer starving time. Because fruit and other edible plant food sources are not yet ready to consume.\nSo why is T2DM increasing even or especially in places where famine does not occur. We are now entering into the most speculative area of my thinking.\nWhile we have plenty of food how is it different from what our ancestors ate?\nRealize that I live in the USA.\nThere is very little truly fresh food available. It is stored, shipped, gassed and so forth.\nMuch food is processed with chemical additives to preserve and enhance flavor because such processing tends to destroy flavor.\nWe don\u2019t eat fruits and vegetables in season and from local sources.\nI suggest that chemicals and enzymes in our foods are signaling to that complex of famine survival genes that starving time is coming. The body goes into famine mode storing against the coming famine. The problem is the famine signals never cease and the body gets stuck forever in famine mode.\nOnce entrenched into famine mode and type 2 diabetes mellitus it is not possible to completely turn off famine mode. What can be done is to attack some of the aggravating factors.\nDiet - Eliminate all simple carbohydrates such as sugar, HFCS, refined grain flours, rice and potatoes. More complex carbs should be restricted. What food eating should be as fresh and as locally produced as possible.\nObesity - The loss of excess weight can really increase insulin receptor sensitivity. This will help normalize blood glucose levels and make #3 possible and enjoyable.\nRegular exercise - I find great benefits from aerobic activity such as walking, running, hiking, swimming and bicycling. The muscles require glucose to work. That alone will decrease BG levels. Some weight training is good because larger muscles will decrease BG by storing more glucose.\nDrugs - There are oral medications that help in a number of ways. It is important to normalize BG levels before complications set in. Depending upon high advance one is whether drug therapy should be initialized. Often many can start oral meds, but by doing 1 to 3 be weaned of the meds. This may last for a life time or BG levels may begin to elevate requiring a return to some form of medication. The importing thing is to get blood glucose levels as close to the normal range as possible.\nWithout doing 1 to 3 drugs will be of limited help. Just taking a tablet and eating a serving of baklava is the path to destruction. (I used baklava as an example because I really like it. Haven\u2019t had any in 28 years).",

This article will talk about the 9 steps you can take to get rid of diabetes.\nWhat is Diabetes?\nDiabetes is a condition in which the body doesn't produce enough insulin or can't use the insulin it does produce properly.\nThere are two main types of diabetes: type 1 and type 2. Type 1 diabetes is usually caused by a virus, and usually affects children or young adults. Type 2 diabetes is usually caused by a combination of genes and lifestyle factors, and often affects middle-aged adults and older people.\nThere are several steps you can take to get rid of diabetes. First, you need to make sure your diet is healthy. You should eat foods that are low in sugar and calories, and include plenty of fruits and vegetables. Second, you need to exercise regularly. This will help to improve your blood sugar levels and reduce the risk of weight gain. Third, you need to monitor your blood sugar levels regularly using a blood glucose monitor or strips. If you have type 1 diabetes, you should also check your blood sugar level twice a day with an insulin pump. One of the best ways to reduce your risk of diabetes is to eat a healthy diet. This means avoiding sugary foods and refined grains, as well as limiting red meat, cheese and processed meats. Try to eat 2 or 3 servings of fruit and vegetables every day. As an added bonus, these foods contain vitamins that can work with insulin to help maintain your blood sugar levels.Low-fat dairy products can be a great source of calcium if you are lactose intolerant or if you choose not to drink milk or eat dairy products for other reasons. This means that nondairy sources such as soy milk, tofu or fortified cereals also provide calcium in your diet. All types of fish, including shellfish and sardines, are also rich\nType 1 and Type 2 Diabetes\nDiabetes is a condition that affects the way your body uses sugar. People with diabetes can have trouble using insulin to control their blood sugar levels.\nThere are a few different steps that you can take to help get rid of diabetes. Some of the most common steps include:\n1. Make sure that you are eating a balanced diet. Include plenty of fruits, vegetables, and grains in your meals.\n2. Limit your intake of sugar and sweetened beverages. These foods can contribute to high blood sugar levels.\n3. Try to get enough exercise. Exercise can help to improve your blood sugar control and reduce your risk of obesity and other health problems.\n4. Monitor your blood sugar levels regularly to make sure that they are in a safe range. If you find that your blood sugar levels are getting too high or too low, talk to your doctor about what steps you can take to address the problem.\nSymptoms of Diabetes\nIf you have diabetes, you may experience some of the following symptoms:\n\u2022 Extreme thirst\n\u2022 Frequent urination\n\u2022 Weight loss or difficulty gaining weight\n\u2022 Pale skin and mucous membranes\n\u2022 Unusual tiredness or weakness\nHow Do I Get Rid of Diabetes with 14 Steps?\nDiabetes is a condition that affects the way your body uses the sugar in your blood. Diabetes is caused by a combination of genetics and lifestyle factors. If you have diabetes, you need to take steps to control it.\n1. Find out if you have diabetes.\nIf you are at risk for diabetes, you should get tested for it. There are several ways to test for diabetes including a blood test, a urine test, or an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).\n2. Make changes to your lifestyle if you do have diabetes.\nIf you have diabetes, you need to make changes to your lifestyle in order to control it. You need to eat a healthy diet and exercise regularly.\n3. Take medications as prescribed by your doctor to control diabetes.\nThere are many different medications available that can help to control diabetes. Your doctor will prescribe the best medication for you based on your specific situation and symptoms.\n4. Educate yourself about diabetes and learn how to manage it on your own.\nYou can learn more about diabetes by reading books, attending seminars, or talking with your doctor or other healthcare professionals.\n5. Advocate for yourself and get support from family and friends when managing diabetes on your own.\nIf you have diabetes and are managing it yourself, you may encounter situations where you feel alone or overwhelmed. You can get support from other people who are also managing their diabetes.\n6. Stay focused on the big picture and maintain a positive attitude about your health. You will be successful in keeping your diabetes under control if you think positively about your condition and stay motivated to deal with it on a daily basis. Diabetes can be both exciting and challenging at the same time!\n7. Exercise regularly - This is one of the most important things you can do to reduce your risk of developing diabetes. Exercise helps to control blood sugar levels, boost your metabolism, and reduce inflammation throughout the body.\n8. Eat a balanced diet \u2013 Make sure to include plenty of fruits and vegetables in your diet to help regulate blood sugar levels and reduce the risk of developing diabetes. Avoid sugar-rich foods, processed foods, and foods with high amounts of saturated fat.\n9. Reduce stress \u2013 Stress can lead to an increase in blood sugar levels and increased susceptibility to diabetes. Take time for yourself each day to relax, meditate, or do something you enjoy.\n10. Get enough sleep \u2013 When you get enough sleep, it helps to improve your overall health and may reduce your risk of developing diabetes. People who get less than six hours of sleep a night are three times more likely to develop diabetes than those who get seven or more hours of sleep a night.\n11. Maintain good dental hygiene \u2013 Poor dental hygiene can increase your risk of developing type 2 diabetes.\n12. Avoid sugary drinks - Sugary drinks are packed with sugar and calories and are a major contributor to obesity and type 2 diabetes. Replace sugary drinks with water or unsweetened tea.\n13. Avoid tobacco - Smoking cigarettes is one of the leading causes of type 2 diabetes. Quit smoking and reduce your exposure to secondhand smoke.\n14. Make sure that you are getting enough fiber. Fiber is important for maintaining bowel function and can also help to reduce the risk of heart disease and other health issues.\nAbout Diabetes: Type 1 diabetes mellitus is an autoimmune disease that occurs when the immune system destroys beta cells (cells involved in insulin production) in the pancreas The body does not produce enough insulin to control blood sugar levels, so lots of calories are absorbed into the blood stream despite the body's attempts to store as many carbohydrates as possible. To remedy this, the pancreas has to do more work than normal to produce enough insulin. When you cannot process food at a normal rate, one of the main things that is affected is your mood and emotional wellbeing. You will have to check with your doctor on dosage adjustments, but it is likely that they will be able to prescribe a medication which will help you keep glucose levels stable so that you can lead a full active life. Successfully managing diabetes is all about making sure your blood sugar levels stay within \"normal\" range and maintaining healthy eating habits. Losing weight is another factor which has to be kept in mind. The more fat you have in your body, the harder it will be for your body to process glucose in order to supply all the cells in your body with energy. This is something which cannot be ignored, and if you do not make changes to how you eat, you may find that it becomes difficult for your body to lose weight because there will not be enough energy available for it to burn properly. This can occur even when you are eating a healthy, balanced diet. Therefore, what you need is a balance between maintaining good blood sugar levels and keeping up with a healthy exercise routine, so that both are maintained.\nConclusion\nIf you are living with diabetes, then you know that it can be a frustrating and difficult disease to manage. Fortunately, there are steps that work for most people to get rid of diabetes. In this article, we will discuss the seven steps that have been shown to be effective in managing diabetes. If you follow these steps correctly, you should see a significant reduction in your blood sugar levels and an improvement in your overall health. So what are you waiting for? Take action today and start seeing real improvements in your diabetes management!",

        "a_text": "\u201cWhat is the best oral medication for type 2 diabetes?\u201d\nThe standard first medication after you\u2019ve been diagnosed is Metformin. It\u2019s a pill; it\u2019s been around a long time; there\u2019s lots of data on its efficacy and safety; it\u2019s relatively inexpensive; and you can usually start with a lower dose and work up if necessary. At higher levels it can cause diarrhea. There\u2019s an extended release version helps with that. So does fiber powder.\nJanuvia is a considerably more expensive oral medication that may be added later. And there\u2019s a combination of Januvia and Metformin called Janumet.\nEDIT:\u2014 The day after posting the above, I saw an article on MedPage reporting some studies comparing Metformin with SGLT2 selective inhibitors (Invokana, Farxiga, and Jardiance). As I read the research summaries, the SGLT2 inhibitors are not more effective than Metformin at controlling blood sugar; but they seem to reduce the likelihood of myocardial infarctions. They might also reduce the probability of heart attacks and/or strokes, although the correlations are of marginal statistical significance. And I didn\u2019t see any mechanisms proposed. I see Invokana, Farxiga, and Jardiance advertised on TV a lot. I assume they are more expensive that Metformin. But it you have high risk of MI, HA, or stroke, I suggest talking to your doctor to see if they are worth the extra cost.",

Consider these tips.\nImages: Google images.\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\nWhen it comes to type 2 diabetes \u2014 the most common type of diabetes \u2014 prevention is very important. It's especially important to make diabetes prevention a priority if you're at increased risk of diabetes, such as if you're overweight or you have a family history of the disease or you have been diagnosed with prediabetes (also known as impaired fasting glucose).\nMayo Clinic does not endorse companies or products. Advertising revenue supports our not-for-profit mission.\nDiabetes prevention is as basic as eating more healthfully, becoming more physically active and losing a few extra pounds. It's never too late to start. Making a few simple changes in your lifestyle now may help you avoid the serious health complications of diabetes in the future, such as nerve, kidney and heart damage. Consider these diabetes prevention tips from the American Diabetes Association.\n1. Get more physical activity\nThere are many benefits to regular physical activity. Exercise can help you:\nLose weight\nLower your blood sugar\nBoost your sensitivity to insulin \u2014 which helps keep your blood sugar within a normal range\nResearch shows that aerobic exercise and resistance training can help control diabetes. The greatest benefit comes from a fitness program that includes both.\n2. Get plenty of fiber\nFiber may help you:\nReduce your risk of diabetes by improving your blood sugar control\nLower your risk of heart disease\nPromote weight loss by helping you feel full\nFoods high in fiber include fruits, vegetables, beans, whole grains and nuts.\n3. Go for whole grains\nIt's not clear why, but whole grains may reduce your risk of diabetes and help maintain blood sugar levels. Try to make at least half your grains whole grains.\nMany foods made from whole grains come ready to eat, including various breads, pasta products and cereals. Look for the word \"whole\" on the package and among the first few items in the ingredient list.\n4. Lose extra weight\nIf you're overweight, diabetes prevention may hinge on weight loss. Every pound you lose can improve your health, and you may be surprised by how much. Participants in one large study who lost a modest amount of weight \u2014 around 7 percent of initial body weight \u2014 and exercised regularly reduced the risk of developing diabetes by almost 60 percent.\n5. Skip fad diets and just make healthier choices\nLow-carb diets, the glycemic index diet or other fad diets may help you lose weight at first. But their effectiveness at preventing diabetes and their long-term effects aren't known. And by excluding or strictly limiting a particular food group, you may be giving up essential nutrients and often craving such foods. Instead, make variety and portion control part of your healthy-eating plan.\nWhen to see your doctor\nThe American Diabetes Association recommends blood glucose screening if:\nYou're age 45 or older\nYou're an overweight adult of any age, with one or more additional risk factors for diabetes, such as a family history of diabetes, a personal history of prediabetes or an inactive lifestyle\nAfter age 45, your doctor will likely recommend screening every three years.\nShare your concerns about diabetes prevention with your doctor. He or she will appreciate your efforts to prevent diabetes and may offer additional suggestions based on your medical history or other factors.\nShare\nTweet\nMarch 15, 2019\nMayo Clinic does not endorse companies or products.

        "a_text": "I am going to assume that you are asking about type 1 diabetes.\nInsulin wasn\u2019t invented one hundred years ago. Insulin is the glucose-regulating hormone that exists in almost every animal. In fact, a lobster has insulin that is only slightly different than human insulin. In the 1920s, we were able to isolate insulin from pigs and it was used to start regulating blood sugars in type 1 diabetics. However, there was a lot of allergies to the insulin, so scientists spent a lot of time trying to isolate the genes that produced human insulin.\nIn the 1980s, genetic engineering companies were able to mass produce human insulin, which was a major breakthrough, more important than isolating pig insulin 60 years earlier.\nThroughout the past 40 years or so, the genetically engineered insulin has been greatly refined to include fast, medium, and slow acting versions which are better at regulating glucose levels. We have insulin pumps that release insulin close to how the pancreas would do it. These are also major breakthroughs.\nType 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease, which are very difficult to understand. In this case, the immune system attacks the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas, destroying the ability to produce insulin. We don\u2019t know what the etiology of type 1 diabetes is, but we know it has a genetic component with some sort of environmental trigger, probably a serious viral infection. Once we understand the cause, we may be able to stop it or reverse the damage caused, and maybe cure type 1 diabetes. Some researchers are looking at ways to turn off the autoimmune response, and once that happens, it appears that insulin production returns. But it is only been shown in animal models, and early clinical trials have begun with some interesting results.\nI\u2019m guessing within 10 years we\u2019ll have another major breakthrough.\nBut you are wrong to suggest that the last breakthrough was 100 years ago. Science doesn\u2019t have many eureka movements \u2014 it progresses as data and new hypotheses are tested. There\u2019s not going to be a miracle moment where someone yells, \u201cwe\u2019ve cure diabetes.\u201d Each additional step allows scientists to move closer to a potential cure. I studied insulin and diabetes in grad school, it was a part of my thesis. That was 40 years ago. What I know now, makes my dissertation seem like it was written by cavemen. Seriously, we didn\u2019t know it was an autoimmune disease 40 years ago. We didn\u2019t know the genetics of diabetes. You think that a cure is the end point, but you need to build a foundation of scientific knowledge to get to a cure. It\u2019s evolutionary not revolutionary.",

        "a_text": "I will avoid dragging you into the weeds of physiology and biochemistry. I am writing for a high-school education level layperson.\nRoute one: Infection\nAn uncontrolled diabetic suffers damage to the nerves over time; this is called neuropathy. It can result in pins-and-needles feelings, pain, numbness, and other symptoms. The areas affected classically get called the glove-and-stocking distribution by physicians way older than I. Basically, a diabetic\u2019s nerves in the hands and feet are malfunctioning. Such individuals have poor sensation in their feet and often do not feel injuries properly.\nSecond, uncontrolled diabetes damages blood vessels and usually occurs with comorbidities that further damage blood vessels. This has two effects. First, the person has poor wound healing due to a mix of poor blood supply to the distant parts of the limbs and other metabolic derangements, and second, they have poor transport of immune cells to the distant parts of the limbs. Again, this is usually compounded by the patient\u2019s comorbidities; most of our diabetics have other health conditions that decrease their circulation. Poor circulation also makes it so antibiotic concentrations in any wounds are lower than we might hope for, and antibiotics have to be tailored to the diabetic patient\u2019s other comorbidities (liver and kidney disease often being limiting factors).\nNext, dysregulations due to diabetes cause immune dysfunctions aside from the poor circulation. Essentially, an uncontrolled diabetic has a less efficient immune system and is more susceptible to any pathogens that invade.\nFinally, many diabetics are not taking the best care of themselves for various reasons. Often they show up only when things are in a crisis, especially when poverty is a factor. Never underestimate the social determinants of health!\nSo what happens: In a typical case, our diabetic suffered a small wound to the foot or lower extremity that they didn\u2019t really notice because their nerves are borked (not a technical term). Bacteria invaded and started a fairly typical cellulitis. Due to their decreased sensation, they didn\u2019t really notice. Due to their poor wound healing and poor immune response and poor circulation, the bacteria spread and managed to get to bone or cause enough tissue destruction that it got ugly with resulting infection of the bone (osteomyelitis) or gangrene. Initial antibiotic therapy was less effective due to poor circulation. Due to poverty or other social conditions, the patient didn\u2019t seek out help until the situation was critical and it was lose the foot or lose your life.\nRoute two: Peripheral vascular disease\nDiabetes, on its own, is a risk factor for damage to the blood vessels and high cholesterol, which can cause damage to arteries. Diabetics, due to choices, age, and social determinants, often have other comorbidities that cause them to have poor circulation and higher risk for the arteries of the extremities to become too damaged to sustain the limb. In this case, diabetes is contributory to all the other health issues damaging circulation to the limb until the limb just isn\u2019t going to make it.\nSo what happens: Imagine a patient of 78 years with a two-pack-a-day smoking habit, overweight, high cholesterol, no exercise, diabetic. After a stroke, our patient doesn\u2019t walk anymore. The circulation in our patient\u2019s legs is very, very poor. Eventually, it is so bad that the leg below the knee is non-viable and amputation is the only real option.\nRoute three: Other Causes (Trauma, Surgery, Cancer, etc)\nDiabetes reduces your survivability and ability to heal from any trauma that befalls you. Simply put, our diabetic is not as resilient as a non-diabetic due to those circulatory and immune factors discussed above. When recovering from a devastating illness or injury, they will be far more likely to have a bad outcome. Likewise, if they need surgical care (for example, after an accident) they are far more likely to have dangerous surgical complications. Likewise, if the surgical team tries to save a limb, you can bet a non-diabetic has better odds all other things being equal.",

Eating nutritious meals:\nComplex carbohydrates: Consume more complex carbohydrates like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and pulses. Avoid sugary foods like sweet drinks and processed foods.\nFibre-rich foods: Including fibre-rich foods prevents your blood sugar levels from spiking. Consume fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, and whole grains every day.\nGood fats: Unsaturated fats (MUFA and PUFA) help in lowering cholesterol levels. Nuts, seeds, olive, sunflower, and peanut oil are all great sources of good fats.\nSodium: Restricting sodium intake to 2300mg/ day is helpful. Reduce the use of excess salt and cut down consuming table salt and processed foods.\n2. Creating a balanced meal plan:\nThere are two great ways in which you can manage your meal consumption.\nThe plate technique: Portion management is easier using the plate approach and was designed keeping a 9-inch plate in mind. It helps you plan out the quantities of food groups you should consume.\nHalf of your plate should have non-starchy vegetables, including green leafy vegetables.\nOne-fourth of the plate should have meat or any other protein.\nOne-fourth of the plate should have grains and other starch.\nYou can also add a serving of fruit or dairy and drink water or unsweetened tea or coffee.\n3. Carbohydrate counting:\nKeeping note of how many carbs you consume and setting a limit for each meal will help you stay within your target blood sugar range. This is because foods rich in carbs convert to glucose, thus impacting your blood glucose levels more than other food. Thus, counting carbs can help limit their consumption. It is especially critical for those who take insulin in deciding on the insulin dosage.",

Insulin\u2019s \u201cjob\u201d is to facilitate the transfer of glucose (the fuel EVERY CELL OF THE BODY runs on) from the bloodstream (the body\u2019s \u201cdelivery system\u201d) into all of the cells. Every cell of the body has \u201cinsulin receptors\u201d on it\u2026 and these receptors \u201crecognise\u201d the presence of insulin, and \u201copen\u201d the cell wall so that glucose (a large, crystalline structure) can pass through, and get inside the cell - where it\u2019s \u201cburned\u201d to make ATP (Adenosine TriPhosphate) - energy.\nIn T2 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus), ALL of the cells have impaired insulin response. This is aka \u201cinsulin resistance\u201d. The underlying cause is GENETIC\u2026 but the biochemical cause is this \u201cresistance\u201d. In short - the genetic issue is a flaw in the genetic code that codes for insulin receptors in the cells and their function.\nWhen that function is faulty - the cells don\u2019t get the fuel they need as fast as they need it\u2026 but at the same time; too much glucose builds up in the bloodstream. And this causes damage to EVERY CELL OF THE BODY.\nTo start - glucose is a crystalline structure; imagine running sandy water through a garden hose; that\u2019s what\u2019s happening in ALL of your blood vessels. You\u2019re abraiding the insides of you blood vessels, gradually \u201cwearing them down\u201d from within. AND\u2026 you\u2019re also generating a deadly excess of AGES - Advanced Glycation End productS.\nAGES are created in excessive quantities when too much glucose is present in the blood. Glycation is a chemical process wherein the protein of your haemoglobin binds with portions of the sugar molecules in your blood.

        "a_text": "Hypoglycemia is not a straight-forward condition that exists or presents 24/7. It comes and goes in most people.\nMost of the time it is better called Intermittent Hypoglycemia.\nWhat is critical in particular is driver education. The police say blood sugar issues are a matter for the medical community because it\u2019s a medical condition. The medical community (when you can even get a medical person to comment) says it\u2019s road safety condition and not their bailey-wick. So we have a Mexican stand off on one of the most easily fixed, deadly serious, very common, health and safety issues known to man and no one wants any part of it.\nThere are reasons for that.\nPolice themselves are prime offenders although not as bad in Canada as they used to be. When a fatal accident occurs involving a hypoglycemic person, that person\u2019s blood is not checked unless asked for by the coroner. The problem is that as the involved hypoglycemic becomes aware just before impact, the impending disaster changes the blood sugar instantly and distorts the reading.\nThat is okay with the police, especially when it\u2019s one of their own.\nThere are significant reasons for that:\nWhen you have an accident while you are having a hypoglycemic incident, you are impaired.\nSince you are impaired, your insurance is null and void immediately.\nYou get charged with impaired driving if you live.\nIf you\u2019re a cop and you die, not only is your insurance null and void, your widow\u2019s pension is lost as well.\nThe cruiser is usually a write-off and also uninsured\nThe contents of the cruiser\u2019s computer can be lost especially if there\u2019s an electrical malfunction that fries the electrical system or there\u2019s a fire.\nThe officer\u2019s case load is lost.\nThe investment to develop the officer is also lost.\nAn accident of this nature can easily cost a police department a couple of million for a single vehicle accident where no one else was involved. As soon as others are involved the costs have no upper limit. Taxpayers are on the hook for the whole thing.\nThe most common offenders though are transport truck and long haul heavy equipment drivers.\nThose people typically have zero nutritional knowledge and drive for years with Intermittent Hypoglycemia. They get away with it until they don\u2019t.\nWhen they don\u2019t they generally kill and maim other people. So each of these accidents are devastating due to the scale of the event and the potential for involving other people, structures, the road bed a and sometimes the local environment. These accidents cost millions. That is an expensive outcome for a coffee and a doughnut.\nNow apply what the various physicians have said are the risks to the person affected. As important as they may be on a personal scale, the broader picture can beggar the imagination.\nYet the police and medical authorities throughout North America at least all absolve themselves of the responsibility for taking the initiative to educate the driving public.\nI have been trying to get this subject into the public domain since I wrote a short story for a contest in the Toronto Star in 1998. It didn\u2019t win. Try to imagine how many lives have been lost since because I didn\u2019t win that contest.\nThat\u2019s not to say if I had won anything would have been done. But having won, I\u2019d have had a launch pad to work from. I\u2019m still looking for that launch pad.",

        "a_text": "Q: \u201cDo you have any pro tips for an individual who\u2019s been told they\u2019re likely developing diabetes (type still undetermined)?\u201d\nTo start - the treatment for types 1 and 3c are TOTALLY DIFFERENT from Type 2; and Type 2 is the most common version of DM - Diabetes Mellitus (I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re NOT talking about any of the four types of DI - Diabetes Insipidus).\nFollowing is an outline of the types of DM, with some basics on causes and treatments, which I wrote for a similar query. At the end is a summary of how to PREVENT the development of T2 from \u201cpre-diabetes\u201d (assuming what you\u2019re \u201cdeveloping\u201d IS T2).\nDM - Diabetes Mellitus - refers to one of three conditions that cause BG (Blood Glucose) levels to become elevated. The three basic types of DM are T1 (Type 1), T2 (Type 2), and T3c (Type 3c). People with these diseases are all D's (Diabetics), but more specifically - T1's, T2's, and T3c's.\n\nType 1 diabetes (under 10% of DM patients), which USED to be called Juvenile Diabetes or IDDM (Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus) is caused by one of a group of genetic anomalies in the HLA (Human Leukocyte Antigen) complex on Chromosome 6 of the DNA structure; in those that have one of these anomalies, a \"trigger\" is needed to start the disease process - the known triggers (not all are known) so far are several different viruses (enteroviruses, rubella and mumps are some of the most common \u2013 but there are many).\nWhen triggered, the disease causes the immune system to destroy a tiny portion (about 1% to 2%) of the pancreatic tissue - the part that produces the hormones insulin and amylin. We can live without amylin - but NOT without insulin. Until the extraction and purification of insulin from animal pancreases in 1921, ALL T1's died shortly after dx's (diagnosis). T1 is known as an \"autoimmune\" disease - because it's caused by the immune system attacking its own body, which it's not supposed to do.\nT1, while typically occurring in children (and being the most common chronic childhood disease) can occur at any age. Currently, the \"median age\" at dx's is 14 years old. The short summary of T1 is that people with T1 can produce no insulin because the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas have been destroyed.\nT1 is a rapid developing disease; but there is a slow-forming version usually seen in adults called LADA (Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults), which is also referred to as T1.5 (Type 1.5) - which while in common usage, is not a valid diagnostic code. Ultimately, LADA is simply a slower-forming version of T1.\nNeonatal DM (far less than 1% of all cases of DM) is generally \u201clumped in\u201d with T1; but researchers and some docs consider it to be it\u2019s own disease. In any event, this type occurs in infancy \u2013 even prior to birth in some cases, but within the first 6 months of life. It is the result of lack of insulin \u2013 and/or poor response to glucose-stimulation of insulin response; in both cases, the result is too little insulin. There are two sub-sub types of this condition \u2013 permanent and \u201ctransient\u201d; in cases of transient NDM, the condition may \u201cgo away\u201d \u2013 only to return later. This sub-type is caused by one of several single genetic markers \u2013 making it a monogenic sub-type of DM.\nType 2 diabetes (over 90% of DM patients), which USED to be called Maturity Onset Diabetes or NIDDM (Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus) is caused by cellular resistance to the action of insulin. In essence, even though a T2 produces plenty of insulin (actually, a lot more than non-Diabetics do), it doesn't work right. Insulin's job is to move glucose (a simple sugar) from the bloodstream (the body's delivery system) into the cells of the body, which need it for fuel. When this transfer is too slow, the BG level gets too high - and the cells of the body don't get the fuel they need as fast as it's needed. T2 is caused by an anomalous sequencing of genetic variants located throughout over 80 areas of the human genome, but there are so far THREE that are absolutely confirmed as causative. All three are located near IRS1 (Insulin Receptor Substrate 1) on chromosome 2 of the human genome; these are SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) rs2943650, rs2943634, and rs2972146. These all cause the underlying biochemical issue of IR (Insulin Resistance), but also, they pre-dispose the carrier to a tendency to gain weight easily, and fatigue readily.\nAs T2 is developing\u2026 the patient experiences hunger for longer periods than they should due to the delayed delivery of glucose into the cells; even as they\u2019re eating a large meal, these patients will experience hunger (polyphagia) that will drive them to eat more than they should need\u2026 because the glucose isn\u2019t getting where it\u2019s supposed to go, and the cells signal the brain that they\u2019re \u201chungry\u201d even when there\u2019s plenty of glucose in the system. Later, when the patient is sleeping - the gluco-regulatory system \u201ccatches up\u201d with the \u201cextra\u201d glucose in the blood, and stores it - as fat tissue. This is why so many (70% to 80%) of T2\u2019s are overweight at diagnosis. It\u2019s a SYMPTOM \u2013 not a cause; though excess weight increases insulin resistance.\nAlso\u2026 the lack of fuel getting into the cells leaves those cells short on fuel - and that causes fatigue. This in turn will lead to a more sedentary existence. Again, it\u2019s a symptom - not a cause.\nGDM - Gestational Diabetes Mellitus - is simply T2 that appears during the physiological stress of pregnancy. While the patient has typically not yet developed the symptoms of T2 - their body is susceptible to it, and the hormonal stress of pregnancy \u201cpushes\u201d their gluco-regulatory system \u201cover the edge\u201d into diabetic BG levels. The placenta that supports the foetus produces a number of hormones that inhibit the mother\u2019s cellular response to insulin - and that simply exacerbates her inherent susceptibility to T2. BUT\u2026 generally, after giving birth (and discharging the placenta), the mother will return to \u201cnormal\u201d (non-diabetic) BG levels\u2026 BUT\u2026 the vast majority of women that suffer GDM will go on to develop T2 later in life (about 75% within 25 years\u2026 or 50% within 15 years).\nThere are also 11 slightly different versions of T2 known as MODY (Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young) each of which are associated with a single genetic anomaly in various places in the human genome. These are very rare, and usually not as severe as traditional T2. Many docs also consider these to be completely different types of DM, rather than sub-types of T2.\n\nAll forms of T2 are primarily treated with \u201cdiet\u201d and \u201cexercise\u201d. These are, unfortunately, very vague references to some very specific needs. In short - by \u201cdiet\u201d, we mean carbohydrate limitation (because carbs are the primary source of glucose in our diets), combined with regular BG testing - to learn how many carbs the individual patient can \u201ctolerate\u201d; no two T2s are the same in this regard\u2026 the severity of the insulin resistance varies - A LOT - from patient to patient, so each must learn their personal limits.\nBy \u201cexercise\u201d, we mean ANY type of PA - Physical Activity\u2026 but AT LEAST 4 or 5 days a week, and AT LEAST 35 or 30 minutes per day; more is better. The POINT of this PA is that it IMPROVES cellular response to insulin - in other words, \u201cexercise\u201d addresses the underlying biochemical failing, making the insulin the body makes more effective. This benefit lasts as long as the patient is getting REGULAR PA. ANY activity you enjoy and can stick to is helpful\u2026 walking, biking, swimming, gardening; the \u201ctrick\u201d is to find something you like and can maintain.\nType 3c diabetes (less than 1% of DM patients), or Pancreatogenic DM, is caused by disease or injury to the pancreas that induces the condition - and is very similar to T1 in that insulin production is destroyed or severely limited. Physical injury or one of several diseases can cause this (pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis, pancreatic cancer, chromohaemotosis, et al). In any event - it is ultimately treated like T1 - with insulin injections.\n\nTo diagnose which type you have, the T3c is easily dismissed if you don't have one of the diseases or conditions that cause it. But T2 and T1 MUST be tested for - fortunately, that is easy. The C-peptide test is a test for a type of peptide (Connecting peptide) that is produced in conjunction with, and proportionately to, insulin. Since T1's produce virtually no insulin - they also have little or no C-peptide. T2's, however, have more-than-normal amounts of insulin and C-peptide. So a test for the presence of C-peptide (a simple blood test, and very cheap) is used as a proxy for an insulin test (a complex blood test, and very expensive). Dx'g (diagnosing) by age is a bad method, and is the reason the vast majority of LADA T1's are mis-dx'd as T2's at first - until they continue to sicken (T2 treatments and meds do NOT work for T1's) and the doc's finally do the C-peptide test and start insulin treatment.\n\nThere are also several tests for autoantibodies, which may be present in T1s\u2026 but often, they are no longer present by the time the testing is done. But doctors often have these tests performed just to \u201cconfirm\u201d the C- peptide result; unfortunately, a negative test result is NOT a guarantee that the patient is not T1.\nIn all forms of DM, the most common symptoms are polydipsia (excessive thirst), polyurea (excessive urination) polyphagia (extended hunger) and fatigue. These are ALL caused by elevated BG levels and lack of fuel to the cells. When your blood retains too much glucose that isn't getting into your body's cells, your kidneys try to \"screen\" it out - dumping the glucose into your bladder, which needs water to dilute it into, which becomes urine. Your kidneys \"steal\" the fluids from your body tissue, and use it to make sweetened urine; you get dehydrated, and have to pee a lot. In T1, there is usually a lot of un-sought weight-loss immediately before diagnosis - because without the fuel your body's cells need, your body fuels itself with its own fat and muscle tissue - \"burning\" those off instead of using the glucose in your bloodstream. In T2 - the weight loss usually doesn't happen, and in any event, never to the extent it does in T1. BUT... in LADA T1's, the weight loss, if any, may be very slow.\nSO\u2026 what you eat, while it may contribute to, or forestall, the onset of T2, will NOT \u201ccause\u201d ANY type of DM. Only T2 is a metabolic disorder - T1 and T3c are caused by loss of insulin production. And T2 is CAUSED by genetic bad luck, and a resulting biochemical failure in the gluco-regulatory response - that is NOT related to what you eat, although limiting carbs is an excellent tactic for improving BG levels in those that carry the genetic markers\u2026 or anyone that thinks they may, and wants to forestall it\u2019s onset.\nFinally, for those with \u201cpre-diabetes\u201d, or \u201cdeveloping\u201d T2\u2026 here\u2019s a good intro from NIH on how to prevent the onset of full-blown T2, geared to those with high risk factors for it - and those with \u201cpre-diabetes\u201d (a condition akin to being \u201ca little bit pregnant\u201d): Preventing Type 2 Diabetes | NIDDK\nAnother site on prevention, from the ADA: Risk Test | ADA\nAnother from Mayo Clinic: Diabetes prevention: 5 tips for taking control\nA final one from the endocrinologists: Type 2 Diabetes Prevention: Here's What You Can Do",

This group claims that their product can cure diabetes, which has raised many questions about the credibility of the program. Is Diabetes Freedom legitimate or just another scam? Let\u2019s explore further to see what DFIs claims are and whether it\u2019s worth your time or not.\nDoes It Work?\nWhile Diabetes Freedom is not a scam, we\u2019re going to go out on a limb and say that we\u2019re not convinced that there is any special solution to diabetes. If you\u2019ve been diagnosed with diabetes, there are some things you can do to try and control your blood sugar levels; there are also some things you should probably avoid if you don\u2019t want to raise your chances of developing complications down the road. There are lots of different medications for people with type 2 diabetes, as well as for those who have type 1. There are also many natural remedies that have been shown to be effective in helping people keep their blood glucose under control. In other words, there\u2019s no diabetes cure\u2014but some measures will help keep your condition from getting worse than it already is.\nHow does it work?\nUsers are provided with an eight-week meal plan that features various hypoallergenic meals for breakfast, lunch and dinner. It is supplemented with suggested snacks and an exercise regimen. To ensure users stick to their diet and develop new eating habits, they are provided with tools to track their calories, carbohydrates and fats daily. The progress of each user is monitored by Diabetic Freedom\u2019s team of certified medical professionals through phone consultations throughout their weight loss journey. Is it safe?: According to its website, Diabetic Freedom does not use any ingredients banned by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\nInstead, its proprietary blend of ingredients work together to reduce appetite while increasing energy levels and metabolism so that users can lose up to 10 pounds in two weeks without feeling hungry or fatigued. All ingredients used in its products are natural and have been tested under FDA guidelines.\nDo You need To Commit to The Diet Long Term?\nOne of my pet peeves about many diets, is that they force you to stay on them for life. While some are manageable long term and can be used as part of a healthy lifestyle, others require so much effort that once you start slipping up, it\u2019s hard to get back into eating healthily again. Diabetic freedom seems like a great way to have your cake and eat it too, but if you don\u2019t commit to staying on the diet permanently, there\u2019s no guarantee that your diabetes will disappear. If I were diabetic, I would want something more concrete than freedom from diabetes.\nWhat Will Happen if I Don\u2019t Follow the Program As Instructed?\nYou\u2019ll gain weight, feel sick and out of energy, and feel like you have no hope. And then, you\u2019ll try another program and start feeling bad all over again. You\u2019re diabetic freedom won\u2019t be worth anything if you can\u2019t commit to following through with diet plan. The good news is that it isn\u2019t as hard as you think! You just need to give yourself time to adjust and follow instructions. Remember, your body has been craving sugar for years; cutting it out cold turkey will make you feel awful at first. But stick with it\u2014and stay committed\u2014and soon enough, your body will adjust and you\u2019ll begin feeling better than ever before!\nDoes Dr. Davis Have Any Supportive Evidence?\nDr. Davis, who holds a Ph.D. in exercise physiology, claims that diabetes freedom is possible for anyone, regardless of age or health status. While he doesn\u2019t outright claim that you can cure your diabetes\u2014rather, his approach uses low-glycemic carbohydrates to stop insulin spikes and control blood sugar levels without medication\u2014many of his clients have experienced similar results. In one clinical study sponsored by Diabetic Freedom, 67 percent of those who followed Dr. Davis\u2019s program were able to reduce their medication usage by an average of 75 percent within 12 weeks. The success rate was even higher among patients with type 2 diabetes: 83 percent were able to decrease their medication use after just three months on Dr. Davis\u2019s plan.\nIs there a money back guarantee with this program?\nNo, but there is an ironclad 90-day guarantee. So if after 90 days you haven\u2019t achieved all of your goals, then you can get a full refund. I think that\u2019s totally fair! Plus, they even give you meal plans and help with accountability via live chat and email. That way they make sure that they take care of their customers even after they have paid for their program. How cool is that?\nMy Final Thoughts on Diabetic Freedom:\nI\u2019ve been using Diabetic Freedom for just over two months now and I must say, I\u2019m very impressed. If you are serious about living a diabetes-free life, then definitely give DF a try. There is an entire community of users who support each other in addition to daily email tips. The way DF works (it varies from person to person) but most have said that they have seen improvements in their blood sugar within weeks! While it may not work for everyone, it certainly seems worth a shot if you\u2019re ready to take control of your health.",

        "a_text": "Yes.\nCure by Acupressure +Herbs: Diabetes Tyoe-1 & Type-2 : Our body requires glucose for energy and so wherever possible take glucose in the natural form, from fruits, its juices, honey, cereals, etc. Moreover this glucose/sugar is easily digestible if it is mixed with saliva. In order to control diabetes, it is utmost necessary to chew at least 15 times not only eatables but also drinks. This habit of chewing properly should be formed right from childhood. Further, instead of adding sugar to the milk make it a practice to drink it plain or add a little turmeric powder that gives milk a good taste and also helps the purification of blood, thus leading to healthy skin. Root Causes and their Cure :\n(1) Tension : Remove it as per guidelines given on page 221 for nervous tension.\n(2) Pancreas : In case you find pain on Point No. 25 when pressed, it denotes that this gland is not functioning properly and so enough insulin is not produced to digest the sugar. At that time, if the blood is tested, and found to have 2 % or more, sugar will be found in urine.\nFor correcting this problem, it is necesary to give treatment on all the endocrine glands. Please note that just by giving this treatment Pancreas can be activated.\n(3) When due to any reason, enough glucose is not extracted from the blood to go into cerebro spinal fluid, the content of glucose in the blood increases. This can be found out by pressing on Point No. 16 of Lymph gland. This can be corrected by drinking daily 2 glasses of charged water reduced from 8 glasses for 30 days and then reduced from 4 glasses for further 30 days and giving treatment on point No. 16. (For more details read book title \"Health in Your Hands : Volume 2\")\nMoreover, do the following :\n( 1) Add half a teaspoonful of turmeric powder to one teaspoonful of health drink and take it twice a day for 30/45 days.\n( 2 ) Cut two lady's fingers (OKRA - tfNt) lengthwise and soak them in half a glass of water overnight. Squeeze them and drink this water the first thing in the morning. If you are susceptible to cold, this squeezed water may be poured on hot pan and drink warm.\nOR\nDrink half a cup of fresh juice of green coriandar leaves W st%TT/^W^; for 35-40 days as the first thing in the morning.\nOR\nTake 8 to 10 mango leaves, soak them in water for half an hour. Then grind the leaves and drink the juice for 35-40 days, the first thing in the morning.\nAfter drinking any of the above drinks, you can have regular breakfast after 15-20 minutes.\n10 to 12 days after you have started this treatment, check up the glucose content in the blood. You will be surprised to find that it is coming down and is under control. Then go on reducing medication for diabetes-pills or insulin injection in such a way as to stop it totally within next ten days. Continue the treatment and just within 30-40 days the sugar level will become normal. Continue Acupressure, habit of chewing food and drinking green juice and enjoy the sweet taste and life. Thus this dreaded disease can be easily brought under control.\nCase Study : A government officer had 4.5% glucose in blood. He started drinking the above mentioned juice of green coriander leaves and two glasses of gold/silver/ copper charged water along with Acupressure treatment. Within 35 days the glucose level in the blood became normal. Prior to treatment, he was not able to walk. He is now able to walk 4 to 5 miles at a stretch. Thus, he regained his health.",

Eat more complex carbs such as whole grains sparingly.\nFind an exercise routine you will do. In my experience the best thing to help get blood glucose levels in control is aerobic work outs. Fortunately for me I love bicycle riding. Long steady distance keeping the heart rate at tempo or above is great.\nTake meds prescribed as directed.\nUse your meter to find what foods affect your B.G. the most and to keep track of your progress as how diet, exercise, weight loss and meds. This is important because you may begin experiencing hypoglycemia (low blood glucose) because of the changes you have made. If you begin experiencing hypos consult with your doctor about medication changes. If you are in the early stages by doing 1,2,3&6 you may be able to normalized blood glucose levels at least for a while.\nFind some method to drain chronic stress from your life. Stress raises blood glucose and chronic stress keeps it high.\nAvoid corticosteroid medications if possible.\nRead books like Dr. Richard Bernstein\u2019s Diabetes Solution and go to the American Diabetes Association web site.\nTake a class with a good certified diabetes educator.

Having diabetes can also cause you to lose more hair than usual. Hair loss isn't just on your head. You can also lose hair on your arms, legs, and other parts of your body. When hair grows back, it will grow at a slower rate than normal.\nPeople with diabetes are more likely to have a condition called alopecia areata. This alopecia condition causes the immune system to attack the hair follicles and cause hair loss on the head and other parts of the body.\nYou may also lose hair as a side effect of taking diabetes medication to help control your blood sugar. Some people with diabetes also have thyroid disease which can contribute to hair loss.\nHowever, good control of blood sugar can help reverse the effects of hair loss.

When done regularly, exercise will help you better control and manage your diabetes, which reduces your chances of developing long term complications. This is because when you exercise, your body consumes more oxygen and your muscles use glycogen, triglycerides, and free fatty acids for energy. For your body to continue functioning properly during heightened bouts of exercise, your blood sugar levels become stable and start to naturally decrease.\nAfter exercising, your blood sugar levels drop and you reap the benefits for hours. At the very basic level, exercising reduces the amount of insulin your body needs to process carbohydrates.3 In this article, we\u2019ll discuss the effect that exercise has on both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.\nWhen you start exercising, your insulin sensitivity is increased. This allows your muscles to use any readily available insulin to take up glucose during and after exercising. The lasting effect that this has on your insulin levels and blood sugar will depend primarily on the intensity of your activity along with how long you\u2019re active. In some cases, exercising can help lower your blood sugar for up to 24 hours or more after a workout. This is why daily exercise is so highly recommended for people with diabetes. However, everyone is different. Use your blood glucose meter to test your blood sugar before and after exercise to help you understand how it affects you. Knowing your body is critical in managing your blood glucose levels over time. Talk to your doctor if you have any questions or before starting a new exercise program.\nTreatment Diabetes - Click Here To Read",

Such as diabetic foot, neuropathy, foot irritation, adhesive capsulitis, joint pain, etc. There is no substitute for physiotherapy treatment to reduce or treat all these complications.\nA proper diet plan is required along with various exercises. Foods that increase glucose levels should be avoided, and foods that control blood glucose levels should be avoided. People who suffer from pain should avoid certain foods such as sugar, salt, white flour, white rice, dairy foods, ice cream, cheese, fast food, cold drinks, artificial juices, etc. Eat less ghee or butter. Drink plenty of water. Get at least 8 hours of sleep in 24 hours. Avoid smoking.\nPhysiotherapy\nis medicine for today and tomorrow, exercise is medicine for today and tomorrow. Physiotherapy is a breakthrough medical system without side effects that speeds up your life and brings peace of mind.

The process of moving glucose from the blood into the body\u2019s cells relies on a hormone called insulin. Insulin is made by the pancreas, a gland lying behind the stomach. Insulin helps glucose to enter cells, for example, in muscles, liver and fat tissue. When insulin levels are too low or are ineffective, blood glucose levels can raise, which may result in diabetes. There are two main types of diabetes, type 1 and type 2.\nType 1 diabetes (T1DM) typically appears in children and happens because of a lack of insulin. It\u2019s caused when the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas are destroyed by an autoimmune response. The reason for this is still not well understood, but those with a genetic susceptibility are most at risk. There have also been suggestions that viral infections may trigger the process. This type of diabetes is treated with regular insulin injections and is also known as insulin dependent diabetes.\nType 2 diabetes (T2DM) is known as non-insulin dependent diabetes. Insulin is produced, but the muscles that would normally respond by taking up glucose to use as energy storage become insulin resistant, causing glucose levels in the blood to increase. Historically, type 2 diabetes was seen in middle-aged and elderly people and only rarely occurred in young people. Recently, however, it has escalated in all age groups and is now being diagnosed in younger and younger patients including obese adolescents and children.\nDiabetes Medication - Click Here to Read",

It was incredibly uncomfortable but I was absolutely committed to doing this because I did not want to have diabetes destroy my body.\nEducation\nLearn about how much sugar is in the foods and drinks you consume. Learn how much sugar other carbohydrates are converted to in your body. Learn how to read food labels and about all the different forms of sugar. There is a surprising amount of sugar in so many foods, it will amaze you. Learn about how sugar affects your body.\nDietary and Lifestyle Changes\nYou will need to change your diet. No sugary sweets, no sugary soft drinks, no fruit juices, no beer or sweet wines, no sweet fruits, no sauces with sugar like regular ketchup and BBQ sauces no sugar in recipes and at restaurant meals, low carbohydrate diet, smaller portions, exercise daily, mindful eating, lower stress levels, meditation, intermittent fasting.\nThis is a high level of recommendations. I have posted more at the website noted in my credential. If you are really committed to this you can do it. It becomes much easier and, eventually your need and desire for sugar will be gone. I stopped sugar in March of 2017 and have never had a sweet drink since and have no desire for them.

It\u2019s a condition that affects your whole body and gets progressively worse, possibly leading to loss of vision and feeling (especially in your feet and fingertips), as well as kidney disease and heart disease. Having high triglycerides -- a type of fat in the blood -- may be a sign you may have prediabetes or type 2 diabetes. Luckily, with some effort, you can lower your triglycerides -- which can help you lower your chance of developing diabetes.\nThe First Sign: Insulin Resistance\nHigh triglycerides don't cause diabetes. Instead, their levels indicate that your system for turning food into energy isn't working properly.\nNormally, your body makes insulin, which \u201cescorts\u201d glucose -- the type of sugar in your blood --inside your cells. There, your body turns glucose into energy. Insulin also allows your body to use triglycerides for energy.\nA common cause of high triglycerides is excess carbohydrates in your diet. High TG\u2019s signals insulin resistance; that\u2019s when you have excess insulin and blood sugar isn\u2019t responding in normal ways to insulin. This results in higher than normal blood sugar levels.\nIf you have insulin resistance, you\u2019re one step closer to type 2 diabetes.\nStabilize Your Blood Sugar - Click Here to Read",

        "rating": "keep",
        "a_text": "There is, in fact, a clear and consistent correlation between refined sugar consumption and diabetes. But there is no compelling evidence showing that sugar causes diabetes.\nThe evidence\nThis figure comes from a very comprehensive review of studies in humans.[1] Each blue square represents a single study. The statistic reported is called relative risk. When the blue square is to the right of the vertical line, the study showed that higher sugar consumption was associated with diabetes.\nHorizontal lines are error bars; these show the degree of uncertainty in the results. In some cases, those horizontal lines are big, meaning that the study isn\u2019t very precise. In other cases, the horizontal lines are too small to be seen, these are the most precise studies. Overall, there's a slight tendency for people who drink a lot of sugar sweetened beverages to be more likely to become diabetic but the effect is small.\nThe next chart shows studies in which sugar intake was estimated before the people became diabetic. Again, the squares represent individual studies. All but one of them, showed that higher sugar intake predicted the eventual development of diabetes but the degree of risk was small.\nThe literature on this topic is vast and mostly consistent. People who eat a lot of sugar are slightly more likely to be diabetic or eventually become diabetic. Many of these studies tried to control for obesity, socioeconomic status, total energy intake, other foods eaten, age, gender, education, ethnicity/race, and much more. The results have been as consistent as one could hope for in a biomedical topic.\nSo why isn\u2019t this correlation valid?\nAll of those studies are correlational. There don\u2019t appear to be any experiments in which either people or lab rats were given reasonable amounts of sugars for a long period of time.\nCorrelation does not imply causation.[2]\nJust because diabetics have been eating/drinking more sugar than non-diabetics doesn\u2019t establish that sugar causes diabetes.\nOnce you establish a correlation, the usual next step is to confirm it with an experiment.\nThere are some short term trials, up to 6 weeks, showing that replacing glucose-only starch with fructose-containing sucrose altered blood glucose and insulin levels [3] but that isn\u2019t the same as showing that sugar causes diabetes.\nThe absence of experiments on lab rats surprises me. There\u2019s a large number of studies in which scientists fed lab rats sugars but no one seems to have looked at diabetes. There are lots of studies in which lab rats were fed absurd amounts of pure fructose but very few people eat much pure fructose.[4] High-fructose corn syrups in soft drinks contain only 55\u201365% fructose.[5]\nThere is another reason why rat studies might be helpful. Insofar as I can tell, all studies of sugars and diabetes involve asking people how much they ate over one or several days. That kind of data is inaccurate. Overweight people tend to under-report how much they ate and most people can only guess as to how big that sandwich or steak they had was.[6] [7]This chart shows how unreliable this kind of data is.[8]\nRats aren\u2019t the same as people but you can run controlled experiments with them and you can closely measure how much they eat, something that is hard to do with people.\nOpposing views\nScientists disagree on this issue. Some think sugar is toxic:[9] [10]\nBut other scientists think that the scientific evidence for those claims isn\u2019t all that strong. One article looked at the evidence and concluded that there is no compelling evidence that sugars cause diabetes.[11]\nIf there are any adverse effects of sugar, they are due entirely to the calories it provides, and it is therefore indistinguishable from any other caloric food. Excess total energy consumption seems far more likely to be the cause of obesity and diabetes. Although many individuals can lose a substantial amount of weight and thereby also delay the onset of diabetes, to do so has relied on an overall reduction in energy consumption. Thus, if reduced energy intake is desirable, all caloric foods are candidates. A reduction in consumption of added sugars should head the list because they provide no essential nutrients.\nThere\u2019s a similar story for alcohol. Nobody knows for sure whether it extends life.[12] [13]Similar issues appear for other kinds of nutritional studies. You can get an excellent discussion in this article: [14]\nPersonal involvement\nBack in the 20th Century, I published papers arguing sugars produce overeating in rats on account of their sensory effects, rather than their nutritional effects.

That scary claim the GOP advanced about how if the Government set up market exchanges for insurance, that somehow the Government would set up \u2018death panels\u2019 and it would be totally different from how insurance companies do it?\nYeah, it looks like \u2018fat camp\u2019 is the new \u2018death panels\u2019. It\u2019s a bad-faith thought-stopper, put there to turn you off from the subject.\nOn the off chance that this is a matter of good-faith misunderstanding, I will note that in discussing his plan, politico reported that:\nSanders proposed a set of ways to cover the plan\u2019s costs including separate new progressive taxes on workers and on employers, raising taxes on the wealthy and imposing a fee on large financial institutions. He also argues that the economic benefits of a healthier population would far outweigh the up-front cost of guaranteeing coverage for all. ~[Sanders unveils revamped 'Medicare for All' plan\n]\nThat last bit, about \u2018the economic benefits of a healthier population\u2019? Almost certainly, what Sanders is talking about is the health dividend of not putting off medical care, not some requirement that the fatties get skinny:\n1 in 4 Americans skip treatment due to the cost.\n1 in 5 can\u2019t afford their medicine.\n34 million are uninsured.\nAnd we still spend twice as much per capita on health care than any other country.#MedicareForAll is a moral and economic necessity.\n\u2014 Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) April 10, 2019\nHe\u2019s posted multiple times of late on how much Americans forego health care out of financial duress, that he believes this to be a moral problem. Thus, if you want to look at his optimism (if people get health care in the regular way, they\u2019ll be healthier) that this will make health care less costly and infer a sinister plan to make the government into an invasive big-brother entity, you\u2019ll have to go deep into the rabbit-hole to come back up with anything like a solid basis for that notion.\nAfter all, one of the major drivers of our health care is that untreated chronic issues eventually end up in the Emergency Room- and that, in turn, is insanely expensive. Sanders is talking up the idea that when folks get regular care instead of letting their problems fester into emergencies, it could help to bend the cost curve.\nTo extend the \u2018save money by putting off health care\u2019 metaphor, I know a very nice lady who once tried to save money by not putting oil in her car. Eventually, she had to replace the motor in her car, because that\u2019s what happens when you don\u2019t do regular maintenance. And the motor cost a lot more to replace than she ever \u2018saved\u2019 by not spending to replace the oil in it. When you look at it this way, regular basic health care might cost something at the time, but it can also prevent minor issues from becoming major ones.\nAlready as I look around at other answers, there are assertions that \u2018Medicare for all will drive up costs\u201d\u2014- note that these claims aren\u2019t accompanied by evidence or citations. They\u2019re just bad-faith talking points, put there to prevent people from considering that every universal care system in the world costs less than the one we have today.\nSanders\u2019 proposal is to get rid of health care premiums entirely, to replace them with payroll taxes and higher taxes on the very wealthy. No, you\u2019re not going to be priced out of your health care if M4A becomes reality- likely you\u2019ll end up paying less than you do today. Also, the talk about \u2018ending up uninsured\u2019 in a country that insures EVERYONE is\u2026 well, more death panels.\nMedicare for all will insure\u2026 ALL of us. ALL.\nIt isn\u2019t called \u2018medicare for the rich\u2019, or even \u2018medicare for some\u2019. The idea that you should be worried about being \u2018priced out of the market\u2019 for universal health care is inconsistent with the idea that it is universal health care. The whole point to UHC is that you can\u2019t be priced out of it.",

Just conduct the following experiment on two consecutive days.\nOn day one, drink a nice big 16-oz glass of orange juice in the morning.\nOn day two, have eight oranges for breakfast.\nWhat? You couldn't finish the oranges?\nThey both have equivalent amounts of sugar, comparable to soda. But the oranges also come with fiber and bulk, which is why you probably balked after your second or third orange.\nPlus, that fiber slows the absorption of sugar into the bloodstream so that the body is better equipped to handle it. And the orange itself takes time to digest.\nOrange Juice - Not as Healthy as you Think\nBut with that orange juice, you may as well be mainlining the sugar. It goes straight to the bloodstream, except for the fructose in it (sucrose is 50% fructose), because humans can't metabolize fructose. Hummingbirds can; people can't.\nSo fructose goes to the liver instead, where it's stored as liver fat until it can be converted to glucose for energy. Repeated high doses of fructose \u2014 the average American consumes 17 teaspoons of added sugar per day (and this doesn't include the sugar in whole fruit) \u2014 lead to non-alcoholic fatty liver, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes.\nHere's what fatty liver looks like. Kind of like a burnt potato chip in a 2-D rendering.\nThe liver is capable of handling moderate helpings of fruit in a well-balanced diet.

Maybe they'll use a glucometer for a quck reading, perhaps they will judge you can wait longer and draw a proper blood sample, but the result will be the same. Unless you're a diabetic with serious hyperglycemia and didn't have to fake anything that reading will be below 11.1 mmol/L, more likely half that. At that point they excluded sugar spike and soon someoe will come to a conclusion the sample was mislabeled.\nThey will absolutely think they have someone else with a sugar spike and possibly have a bunch of people re-tested for no good reason, but that's on you and your little faking.

Scientists and physicians have been chronicling this devastating medical condition for more than 3,000 years, from the origins of its discovery to the dramatic breakthroughs in its treatment. In antiquity, a diagnosis of diabetes was likely a death sentence.\nCedar wood panel depicting Hesy-Ra (Hesy-Ra - Wikipedia\n)\nThe first known mention of diabetes symptoms was in the Ebers Papyrus 1552 B.C., where Hesy-Ra a third dynasty physician (whose title was Wer-ibeh-senjw, meaning either \"Great one of the ivory cutters\" or \"Great one of the dentists\"), documented frequent urination as a symptom of a mysterious disease that also caused emaciation. Hesy-Ra mentions the \u201ctoo great emptying of the urine'.\nThe following mixture was prescribed for the treatment of polyuria (excessive urination): \u2018A measuring glass filled with Water from the Bird pond, Elderberry, Fibres of the asit plant, Fresh Milk, Beer-Swill, Flower of the Cucumber, and Green Dates\u201d.[2]\nIt's unclear whether the condition described was excessive urine (polyuria), which may have been symptomatic of diabetes, or increased frequency of urine, resulting from a urinary tract infection[3] . Urinary troubles were corrected with rectal injections of olive oil, honey, sweet beer, sea salt, and seeds of the wonderfruit.[4]\nEgyptian medicine influenced the medical practices of neighboring cultures, including the culture of ancient Greece. Although the Greek physician Hippocrates, the father of medicine, did not specifically mention diabetes in his writings, there are accounts in the Hippocratic writings that are consistent with the signs and symptoms of diabetes.[5] There are references to excessive urinary flow with wasting of the body. Hippocrates promoted the concept of preventive medicine, stressimg the influence of diet, exercise, and lifestyle on health.[6]\n(Origin of surgery Sushruta (Origin of surgery Sushruta - Fancy Frindle\n)\nThe ancient Indian physician, Sushruta (6th century BC), and the surgeon Charaka (400\u2013500 A.D.) were able to identify the two types, later to be named Type I and Type II diabetes.[7] Sushruta called diabetes the disease of madhu-meha, i.e., sweet urine.[8] The first clinical test of diabetes was devised in Ancient India, where patients exhibiting the common diabetes symptoms described above, had their urine analyzed with the help of ants.[9] If the sugar-loving ants came rushing to the urine, a diagnosis of \u201cmadhumeha\u201d was given, indicating the patient had \u201choney urine\u201d, with elevated levels of glucose in the urine.[10]\nAnother ancient Ayurveda physician, Charaka, who lived in the 3rd century BCE called diabetes the disease of prameha, referring to abnormally high outputs of urine.[11] Both physicians advocated abstaining from sweet foods and reducing the intake of rice and other grains as part of the treatment of diabetes.[12]\nApollonius of Memphis (A history of Diabetes timeline)\nThere are two contenders for coining the term diabetes meaning to pass through. The first is Apollonius of Memphis, around 250 BC, while the second is Demetrius of Apamea (1st century BCE).[13] Apollonius of Memphis. is credited with naming the disorder for its top symptom: the excessive passing of urine through the body\u2019s system.[14] Demetrius, likened polyuria to the siphoning of wine between pots\u2014a practice now called \"racking,\" which has long been used during fermentation to remove the sediment of dead yeast and promote proper aging.[15]\nCaelius Aurelianus prepared a Latin version of the works of Soranus, including in the index a subject heading for \"Diabetes\u201d. Caelius quotes Apollonius of Memphis as separating two forms of dropsy, one marked by retention of fluid and the other by the inability to retain fluid; the patient discharges whatever he drinks as if it were passed through a pipe. Caelius Aurelianus continues by stating that Demetrius distinguishes this disease from dropsy in which any fluid that is drunk is discharged as urine. Demetrius calls this condition diabetes.[16]\nAulus (Aurelius) Cornelius Celsus, a Roman physician, was credited with the first recording of the cardinal signs of inflammation, which included calor (warmth), dolor (pain), tumor (swelling), and rubor (redness and hyperemia).[17] He describes a condition likely to be diabetes, calling it \"excessive pouring out of urine\" causing \"emaciation and danger\u201d.[18]\nIn the first century A.D., ancient Greek physician Aretaeus vividly described the destructive nature of an illness which he named diabetes derived from the Greek word \u201csiphon\u201d (meaning flowing through).[19]\nDiabetes is \u2026 not very frequent ... being a melting down of the flesh and limbs into urine \u2026 for the patients never stop making water, but the flow is incessant, as if from the opening of aqueducts. It consists in the flesh and bones running together into the urine \u2026 the illness develops very slowly. The nature of the disease is chronic, and it takes a long period to form; but the patient does not live long once the disease is fully established; for the melting is rapid, the death speedy. Moreover life is disgusting and painful; thirst, unquenchable \u2026 and one cannot stop them either from drinking or making water\".[20]\nDiabetes indeed appears to have been a death sentence in the ancient era: Aretaeus did attempt to treat it, but could not provide a good prognosis. He commented that \"life (with diabetes) is short, disgusting and painful\u201d.[21] In 164 AD, building upon Aretaeus\u2019 assessment, Greek physician, Galen of Pergamum, categorized diabetes as an ailment of the kidneys.[22]\nThe Origins of Diabetes | St. Hope Foundation\nFor several hundred years, the treatises of Aretaeus and Galen remained the definitive reference for the diagnosis of diabetes, but offered no cures. To the east, Chinese physicians described the disease similarly, labeling it xiao ke (wasting and thirsting), a term still used today.[23] Xiaoke tea, a traditional Chinese treatment for diabetes mellitus was thought to lower blood glucose concentrations.[24]\nAs the Middle Ages began, diabetes was known as the \u201cpissing evil\u201d[25] , commonly diagnosed by \u201cwater tasters\u201d, who tasted the urine of people thought to have diabetes to see if the excretion was sweet like honey.[26] Avicenna (980\u20131037 A.D.), the great Persian physician, in The Canon of Medicine not only referred to abnormal appetite and the decline of sexual functions, but observed diabetic gangrene but also concocted a mixture of seeds (lupin, fenugreek, zedoary) as a panacea.[27]\nThomas Willis in the late 1600s added the term mellitus or \"from honey\" to separate the condition from diabetes insipidus, which is also associated with frequent urination.[28] Willis was infamous for his diagnosis of diabetes, which involved tasting the urine of his patients.[29] He associated diabetes with depression (\u201cdiabetes is caused by melancholy\u201d), an observation that was only rediscovered three centuries later.[30]\nWith little understanding of pathophysiology, early remedies for diabetes included diverse and interesting prescriptions like \u201coil of roses, dates, raw quinces and gruel, jelly of viper\u2019s flesh, broken red coral, sweet almonds and fresh flowers of blind nettles\u201d representing a variety of beliefs and practices of the times.[31] The prescribed treatment was exercise, which is consistent with medical advice for today, but with one difference: the preferred method of exercise was horseback riding.[32] It was thought that this would decrease urination frequency.\nLater, in the pre-insulin era, calorie restriction reigned supreme, and graphic accounts of the terminal gasping and sighing and sweet smell (ketosis) surrounding the patient in a diabetic coma abound in the volumes written on the disease.[33]\nResearch published in the journal \u2018Nature\u2019 reveals that the likelihood of non-African Homo sapiens developing conditions, particularly auto-immune disorders, which can be determined by Neanderthal alleles. DNA sequencing was conducted on a recent skeletal discovery from Denisova Cave, indicating that what were considered modern diseases originated in our Neanderthal ancestors.[34] The diseases included type two diabetes, Crohn's disease, lupus and biliary cirrhosis.[35]\nThe deep roots of diabetes\nThe diagnosis of diabetes mellitus from skeletal remains is very difficult given the complexity of the disease and the fact that there are no pathological skeletal characteristics exclusively associated with the condition.[36] Skeletal identification of diabetes mellitus may only be possible through differential diagnosis, when several pathological changes are present. Skeletal and dental changes associated with diabetes mellitus include Charcot's joint (neuropathic arthropathy), osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH, or Forestier's disease), adhesive capsulitis (frozen shoulder), dental caries, periodontal disease, and antemortem tooth loss.[37]\nIt should not be understood that Neanderthals had diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is a disease of the modern world, borne of a mismatch between modern, unhealthy lifestyles and a metabolism that, for the vast majority of our evolutionary history, existed in an environment where food was relatively scarce and lots of physical activity was necessary to survive.[38] In the harsh environment of the Ice Age, even individuals carrying genes that contribute to diabetes when food is plentiful and sedentary lifestyles are common are unlikely to develop diabetes.\nSkeletal remains of an adult male from the Egyptian archaeological site of Dayr al Barsha dated to the Middle Kingdom (ca. 2055\u20131650 BC), display a myriad of pathological conditions that, when considered together, indicate the presence of diabetes mellitus.[39] This diagnosis represents the earliest, and possibly the only recorded, archaeological Raf inhibitor skeletal evidence for this disease.\n(Ancient Mummy Suffered Rare And Painful Disease\n)\nAround 2,900 years ago, an ancient Egyptian man, likely in his 20s, passed away after suffering from a rare, cancer-like disease that may also have left him with a type of diabetes. His mummy showed telltale signs that he suffered from Hand-Schuller-Christian disease an enigmatic condition in which Langerhans cells, a type of immune cell found in the skin, multiply rapidly.[40] They tend to replace normal structure of the bone and all other soft tissues.\nThe disease seems to have taken a terrible toll on the ancient man\u2019s body, as it destroyed parts of his skeleton, leaving lytic lesions throughout his spine and skull.[41] Scans also indicated what looks like a giant hole in his skull\u2019s frontal-parietal bone, and destruction of a section of one of his eye sockets, known as the orbital wall. The effects of the disease would have been excruciating and would have affected the man\u2019s appearance. In addition, it may have led him to suffer from a form of diabetes. The scans show that his sella turcica, part of the skull that holds the pituitary gland, is shallow, which suggests that this gland was also affected by the disease.[42]\nResearchers believe the condition could have lead to diabetes insipius. The condition would have made it difficult for his kidneys to conserve water, something that would have worsened the man\u2019s predicament.[43] In all likelihood, he suffered from continuous thirst and hunger, urinating frequently.\nHatsheput (Metropolitan Museum of Art - Wikipedia\n)\nRecent examination of a mummy considered to be Hatshesput (Pharoah of the XVIIIth dynasty 1503 and 1482BC) suggests she probably died of an infection caused by an abscessed tooth, with complications from advanced bone cancer and possibly diabetes.[44] Amenhotep III, the ninth pharaoh of the Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt, may have suffered from diabetes as well.[45]\nArchaeological evidence indicates that certain groups of Paleo-Indians maintained an arctic-like hunter-gatherer life-style in temperate areas of North America ranging from Wyoming to Arizona. This life-style featured a reliance on unpredictable big game species as a major food source. However, at this time, big game species were becoming extinct. It is hypothesized that those Paleo-Indians who relied on big game as a food source developed a \u201cthrifty\u201d genotype,[46] that allowed a selective advantage during the periods of fasting that occurred between big game kills.\nInsulin resistance has previously been proposed as a mechanism for coping with variable food intake during evolution. Neel's thrifty gene hypothesis postulates that cycles of feast and famine selected for a \u201cquick insulin trigger\u201d (postprandial hyperinsulinemia) as a mechanism to increase fat stores during food abundance and available during food scarcity.[47]\nThere is a high prevalence of (Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes (NIDDM) susceptible genotypes in several distinct populations: American Indians, Australian Aborigines, and Pacific Islanders.[48] The susceptible genotype may have been selected into these populations because of unusually frequent food shortages that occurred during the initial colonization of 'new worlds'. NIDDM has been shown to have a strong genetic component that may include a 'thrifty' genotypes.[49] The 'thrifty' genotypes may have once allowed founding populations to survive feast' and 'famine' conditions for several generations. With an assured food supply and a sedentary lifestyle, however, the 'thrifty' genotype(s) becomes disadvantageous, leading to obesity, increased insulin resistance, beta cell decompensation, and NIDDM.[50]\nNew DNA techniques will spark archeology revolution, expert says\nDuring the same time period, across the Atlantic Ocean, it is believed that inhabitants began to exhibit symptoms of what would eventually be classified as Juvenile diabetes. During a 1000 year climatic reversal known as the Younger Dryas, temperatures dropped by 10 degrees Fahrenheit, causing those who did not die from the artic conditions to move South.[51] Researchers from Mount Sinai School of Medicine of New York suggest that some individuals adapted to the extreme conditions. High levels of blood glucose prevent cells and tissue form forming ice crystals. Basically, Type 1 diabetes prevented some from freezing to death.[52]\nFood during the last Ice Age was almost certainly limited, meaning that dietary blood sugar likely followed suit. Therefore, the insulin of a diabetic from this epoch may have never come close to reaching dangerous levels.\nThe following quote is from Sharon Moalem:\nImagine that some small group of people had a different response to the cold. Faced with year-round frigid temperatures, their insulin supply slowed, allowing their blood sugar to rise somewhat. As in the wood frog, this would have lowered the freezing point of their blood. They urinated frequently, to keep internal water levels low\u2026 Suppose these people used their brown fat to burn that oversupply of sugar in their blood to create heat. Perhaps they even produced additional clotting factor to repair tissue damage caused by particularly deep cold snaps. It\u2019s not hard to imagine that these people might have had enough of an advantage over other humans\u2026 to make it more likely that they would survive long enough to reach reproductive age.\u201d[53]\nMany in the medical community are skeptical, asserting that the study fails to account for dangerous complications such as ketoacidosis and early death.[54] However, since the average age of death was 25, those with high glucose would not have lived long enough to succomb to complications. They would however, despite the extreme conditions, live long enough to reproduce, resulting in genetic adaptations over a few generations.[55]\nWhile this may sound highly speculative, there\u2019s actually a decent amount of evidence to support the notion. Lab rats essentially become diabetic (that is, they grow resistant to their own insulin) when exposed to cold temperatures.[56]\nMore Northern Hemisphere inhabitants are diagnosed with diabetes between November and February than between June and September, theoretically due to the noticable drop in temperature during the former period.[57] Almost invariably, children are diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes during the late fall as temperatures drop. An extensive study of U.S. veterans, revealed that not only do the subjects\u2019 blood sugar levels spike while winter is at hand, but that those who hail from environments with a great deal of variation in seasonal temperature (ie: colder districts) had a particularly extreme physiological contrast in this regard.[58]\nFootnotes\n[1] Aretaeus of Cappadocia\n[2] Polyuria - Genitourinary Disorders - Merck Manuals Professional Edition\n[3] MECHANISMS OF PAIN FROM URINARY TRACT INFECTION\n[4] The Ebers Papyrus: Medico-Magical Beliefs and Treatments Revealed in Ancient Egyptian Medical Text\n[5] Historical Diabetes Remedies\n[6] Diagnosing Diabetes: A Practitioner's Plea: Keep It Simple\n[7] The History of Diabetes Mellitus\n[8] History of Diabetes Mellitus\n[9] https://mysugr.com/en/blog/ants-with-diabetes\n[10] https://www.nhp.gov.in/Madhumeha-(Diabetes-mellitus)_mtl\n[11] https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=http://www.jsirjournal.com/Vol4_Issue4_08.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwiqseuKlpzlAhUQpJ4KHWgLBZ8QFjAFegQICxAB&usg=AOvVaw275X45OeYFJcauml-J1PW7\n[12] Diabetes in Ancient Literature\n[13] Diabetes Detectives\n[14] The Origins of Diabetes | St. Hope Foundation\n[15] The Discovery of Insulin: An Important Milestone in the History of Medicine\n[16] Diabetes Its Medical and Cultural History\n[17] Inflammation, Insulin Resistance, and Type 2 Diabetes: Back to the Future?\n[18] https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://friedmanfellows.com/assets/pdfs/elibrary/Principles%2520of%2520Diabetes%2520Mellitus%2520-%2520Ch1Final.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwiM6b2smJzlAhXYvJ4KHSVgCQEQFjAKegQICRAB&usg=AOvVaw0kllZ_wHWefc_uHQif9Eqd&cshid=1571071278134\n[19] Aretaeus of Cappadocia and the first description of diabetes.\n[20] Aretaeus of Cappadocia\n[21] History of diabetes: early science, early treatment, insulin\n[22] On the term diabetes in the works of Aretaeus and Galen | Medical History | Cambridge Core\n[23] Xiaoke, a traditional Chinese treatment for diabetes.

My lancets here have little plastic caps to minimise the chances of accidental injury.\nLancets, as well as syringes, get disposed of in a yellow sharps container. I put in an order for one every month with the rest of my medications, and pick it up at the pharmacy at the same time, and when it\u2019s full I email the city council to arrange a pickup, and they collect it from my doorstep. (I usually wait till I have two or three full ones to arrange a collection.) I\u2019m not sure what the process is like in other countries (or indeed, other towns).\nDon\u2019t worry, that black thing is just a bit of fluff, not a dead spider (nor a live one).\nMy finger pricker has 8 depth settings. I usually have it set to 4 for my fingers. I googled \u201cis the skin on your earlobes thicker than the skin on your fingers\u201d and various variations, but couldn\u2019t get an answer. I\u2019m going to try it on 3, but I may need to increase it.\nI have one sterile wipe left...which is unfortunately two years out of date. They\u2019re expensive, and I pretty much only test at home, so I usually just wash my hands really well with antibacterial soap. I guess we\u2019ll try that on my ear.\nDamn, I already need to buy test strips soon. I\u2019m supposed to get them free, but my doctors are being weird lately, and I\u2019ve been paying \u00a315 a month from eBay.\nMy meter is compact, and it won\u2019t connect to the app on my phone anymore (I really need a new one) but it holds the last five readings. They\u2019re all over the place, but mostly higher than I want, because I had a hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (HHS) last week - a high-sugar medical emergency that I had to go to hospital for.\nOK, we can do this.\nSetting 3 didn\u2019t even bleed. Let\u2019s try 4.\n4 got me a tiny bit of blood, but not enough - my machine gives an error reading if there\u2019s not enough blood on the strip. Trying 5.\n5 gave a decent amount! Better than a finger. I\u2019ll have to remember that.\nHmm. Still high. Not close to \u201chospitalisation required\u201d high, but higher than I want. It really needs to be under 10. Under 8 would be better, but this close to an HHS, and with a Crohn\u2019s flareup, I\u2019ll take anything under 10 as a win. 13.1 isn\u2019t the 34.whatever I tested last week, which sent me into hospital, but it\u2019s not good either.\nI\u2019m a little surprised that pricking my earlobe didn\u2019t hurt at all! I didn\u2019t even feel it. It\u2019s surprising because I sometimes get pimples on my ear, which occasionally bleed, and those do hurt. And getting my ears pierced was excruciating the first time, though that was almost 30 years ago. I let them close up during the pandemic, and was definitely not looking forward to getting them repierced, but perhaps it won\u2019t hurt as much as I was expecting.\nFor the sake of comparison, I did a finger prick too. I like to use the side of my ring finger - it bleeds better and hurts less than my other fingers.\nNow, that\u2019s startling. A difference of 1.7 in five minutes is quite a lot. Admittedly, I did eat right before testing, and it\u2019s possible that in five minutes, the food hit my bloodstream. Still, such a stark difference makes me wonder if earlobe testing is less reliable than fingers.\nOverall, while I found it a bit awkward - I definitely needed a mirror and good light, and it took me a bit longer than usual to get things organised and I worried that my blood would dry up or my meter would turn off before I got the reading - the lack of pain makes me think that perhaps the earlobe is indeed a viable test site. The finger still hurts a little after writing this answer, 15 minutes later. The earlobe never hurt, and doesn\u2019t hurt now. Of course, it\u2019s possible that with repeated testing, it will become painful and/or less easily bled, as scar tissue forms. My other concern was that it might bleed for a longer time - the ear pimples I get sometimes bleed for hours or even days without letting up - but it took about the same time to stop bleeding as a finger.\nIf it turns out that the readings are reliable, I would be happy to do earlobe testing in future, either as a primary site or as a secondary site when fingers are sore or not wanting to bleed.\nAnd in American:\nToday\u2019s readings:\n13.1 mmol/L = 235.8 mg/dL\n14.8 mmol/L = 266.4 mg/dL\nReferred to in the post (last week\u2019s readings):\n34.whatever (let\u2019s call it 34.0) mmol/L = >612.0 mg/dL\nLink to blood glucose converter in comments.",

Ancient Persians knew of it too and had a rudimentary procedure to diagnose it: spill urine over some rocks and wait. If it attracts insects the result is positive. This is because urine will contain glucose and insects see it as food.

Though humans may at times have been lucky enough to find small concentrations of fruit, it was not the norm. Human beings are not fundamentally tree climbers like monkeys and could not have gotten to enough fruit to make that a heavy part of the diet on a regular basis.\nThe other thing is that we must remember that most plants that we eat today are engineered organisms that mankind has created through selective breeding over the last several thousand years. Today we are used to finding an abundance of super sweet fruits grown on farms and filling our grocery-store shelves. Prior to the neolithic revolution, there would not have been nearly so many sugary fruits available. Even as late as classical times, it would still have been hard to eat large amounts of sugar like we do today.\nEDIT: Bear in mind, too, that even if you were to gorge yourself on modern fruits, it would be hard to raise your blood sugar level as much as eating a single slice of cake (probably even a single slice of white bread). Modern refined sugar (and refined flour) affects us far more than eating most raw foods.",

Fat deposits can lead to either not enough insulin being supplied to break down the sugars, or no insulin at all.

This particular problem can come on very suddenly (within 24 hours) and can lead to death unless treated.\nThere is also a link between waist size and the risk of developing type II diabetes.\nCurrent UK recommendations from Diabetes UK are:- \u201cDiabetes UK defines a large waist as 31.5 inches or over for women and 35 inches and over for men.\u201d\nIf your waist size is over this it is recommended that you ask your doctor about your risk factors. He/She may want you to have some simple blood tests or more normally a Fasting Blood glucose test. where you will either be given a breakfast containing a known amount of glucose, carbohydrates etc and a drink (Sometime just a drink). Your blood sugars will be tested during and 2 hours after the meal, if after 2 hours your blood glucose levels are 7.0 mmol or higher then you have diabetes. Treatment may be as simple as diet and lifestyle changes, diet and oral medication, mimetics such as Victoza (which mimic the action of insulin), or insulin therapy.\nIf you are at all worried about your risk then talk to your doctor.",

        "a_text": "One of the most basic facts about carbohydrate metabolism is that glucose and fructose are handled differently. For many cells, insulin controls the amount of glucose they take up. But most cells don\u2019t use fructose at all. Instead, around 70% of the fructose you eat is taken up by liver cells (hepatocytes).\nThe brief answer is that these sugars differ because glucose is carried inside most cells through a transporter molecule that is activated by insulin, but fructose is carried inside liver cells by transporters that don\u2019t require insulin.\nThe rest of this answer provides more detail. In the last part of the answer, I want to give an evolutionary perspective. I do that because there are several features of this that have baffled me for decades.\nBiochemical details\nBiological systems aren\u2019t ever simple.\nThere are several different molecules, transporters, which carry sugars into cells. Many cells rely heavily on one called GLUT4 which transports glucose but not fructose. This transporter is depicted in the lower right of the skeletal muscle cell and adipose (fat) cells in this picture.[1] That transporter is activated by insulin.\nInsulin works on this transporter by allowing it to fuse with the cell membrane[2] .\nLiver cells, hepatocytes, rely on different transporter molecules called GLUT5 and probably GLUT8 which can transport fructose without insulin (upper left in the diagram).[3][4]Liver cells also take up glucose through the GLUT2 transporter which doesn\u2019t depend on insulin.\nBut that\u2019s only the beginning. there are several other transporters; each randomly assigned to different organs. (Yes, I did mean to say random.) This chart summarizes them.[5]\nThis chart summarizes the differences in their function as a picture.[6] The arrows depict triggers (gray, fasting conditions; blue, exercise/physical activity; red, diabetes).\nEvolution\nThe difference between glucose and fructose always struck me as one of the many weird, unexplainable, facts about biology. Both sugars are common in fruits and plant juices, so it\u2019s not obvious why they are handled differently.\nHaving so many GLUT transporters is also weird. Why so many?\nIt turns out that that these genes originated through a process of duplication. Once upon a time there was just one GLUT transporter and that one got duplicated, so then there were two. Later on, one of the copies got duplicated so that then there were three. Different copies evolved different functions somewhat randomly.\nThe process is analogous to the evolution of related species except that this involves individual genes becoming separate. Scientists think the genes are related to each other as shown in this diagram.[7]\nMany of these genes are very old; fish have them.[8] Being so ancient is probably why these genes are scattered randomly among our chromosomes.[9]\nConclusion\nAny student trying to learn about GLUT transporters is going to be unhappy about how complex and chaotic this assortment of genes is. My best guess as to why it's so complicated is that it evolved in a trial-and-error way, long, long ago, with organisms sticking with whatever worked, thereby adding needless complexity in the process.\nMore to read\nThis article will tell you more than you want to know:\nGlucose transporters in adipose tissue, liver, and skeletal muscle in metabolic health and disease - Pfl\u00fcgers Archiv - European Journal of Physiology\nA family of facilitative glucose transporters (GLUTs) is involved in regulating tissue-specific glucose uptake and metabolism in the liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue to ensure homeostatic control of blood glucose levels. Reduced glucose transport activity results in aberrant use of energy substrates and is associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. It is well established that GLUT2, the main regulator of hepatic hexose flux, and GLUT4, the workhorse in insulin- and contraction-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle, are critical contributors in the control of whole-body glycemia. However, the molecular mechanism how insulin controls glucose transport across membranes and its relation to impaired glycemic control in type 2 diabetes remains not sufficiently understood. An array of circulating metabolites and hormone-like molecules and potential supplementary glucose transporters play roles in fine-tuning glucose flux between the different organs in response to an altered energy demand.\nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00424-020-02417-x\nFootnotes\n[1] Glucose transporters in adipose tissue, liver, and skeletal muscle in metabolic health and disease - Pfl\u00fcgers Archiv - European Journal of Physiology\n[2] OpenStax CNX\n[3] Glucose transporters in adipose tissue, liver, and skeletal muscle in metabolic health and disease - Pfl\u00fcgers Archiv - European Journal of Physiology\n[4] https://www.researchgate.net/figure/GLUT8-is-a-rate-limiting-cell-surface-hepatic-fructose-transporter-A_fig2_260150047\n[5] Glucose transporter 1 in health and disease Pragallapati S, Manyam R\n[6] Glucose transporters in adipose tissue, liver, and skeletal muscle in metabolic health and disease - Pfl\u00fcgers Archiv - European Journal of Physiology\n[7] https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Dendogram-of-multiple-alignments-of-all-members-of-the-facilitative-glucose-transporter_fig1_235405481\n[8] Genome-wide identification and characterization of glucose transporter (glut) genes in spotted sea bass (Lateolabrax maculatus) and their regulated hepatic expression during short-term starvation\n[9] Glucose transporter 1 in health and disease Pragallapati S, Manyam R",

        "a_text": "Keto diet for Diabetics (Type-2)\nThe keto diet is a high-fat, low-carb diet, which limits carb intake, therefore, lowers blood sugar levels in the blood.\nA ketogenic diet makes changes in your eating habits that improve the blood sugar levels tremendously. A healthy individual is recommended to consume 2000 calories with 25% carbs intake on a daily basis. But following a keto diet, you are supposed to eat 5% of carbs only, which on average, is about 25-30 grams. That is already low enough to avoid any spikes in your blood sugar level!\nSo with carbs so low, where do you get the required energy from? Again, this is where the keto diet steps in. The keto diet transitions your body from being \"glucose-run\" to \"fat-run.\" Your body consumes fats quickly, providing you the energy to conduct all tasks, eventually making you leaner.\nSo this obviously means that the keto diet is excellent for diabetics, right? The answer is not so simple.\nIf we are going to single out one specific group, we really need to keep their limitations in mind too. And when talking about diabetics, we need to keep ketosis in mind. Ketosis is the result of low-carb but a high fat-intake. When you take in fewer carbs, your body starts burning fats and proteins to get the required energy via ketosis. Ketosis converts both, fats as well as proteins in ketones. Ketones then drive your whole body. As far as carbs are concerned, you are taking them in less amount and so there is less amount of sugars produced as a result of carbs breaking down. Therefore, fewer spikes in blood sugar levels!\nHowever, watching out for your ketones level is equally important. High levels of ketones can make the blood acidic. Acidic blood can damage your liver, heart, and kidneys! That\u2019s why it\u2019s imperative that you take account of every nutrient that you intake. This way, you can control your blood sugar level while keeping your body safe from harm of excess ketones.\nBlood sugar levels are determined by hemoglobin A1C testing. People with type-2 diabetes always have more than 7% of A1C levels, whereas people living without diabetes should have A1C score around 5.7%. With a ketogenic diet, it is possible to lower the A1C score. Keto diet focuses on eating more fats and proteins. Taking fewer carbs means consuming fewer starches which in return means lower levels of sugar.\nFats and protein also keep you full for a longer time. As a result, your cravings for food are cut down, and you don\u2019t feel hungry every 2-3 hours.\nKeto Diet for Thyroid Gland:\nFor thyroid disease, it is best to avoid keto diet. As keto diet limits the intake of carbohydrates, which can reduce the production/levels of thyroid hormones in your blood.",

Or more accurately\u2026 when hypoglycaemic, we\u2019re subject to losing all inhibitions and become entirely dysfunctional due to the loss of various brain functions - literally. We can\u2019t focus, we can\u2019t form logical conclusions, and we can\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening\u2026 and as BG (Blood Glucose) drops into the 50s mg/dl (or thereabouts), most folks start to become impatient and belligerent. For some, it may happen at higher levels\u2026 especially those new to the experience.\nFor that\u2026 yes, I\u2019ve experienced this. Many times. About a year and half ago, my wife woke me to tell me that I was low, and needed to consume some glucose\u2026 I argued with her, and insisted\u2026 I was about to strike her, but still realised that was unacceptable, so I put my fists - BOTH of them - through the wall. My left went right through, to the outer wall; my right hit a stud, and crushed the drywall in the spot I hit. By that point\u2026 my wife had a yoo-hoo box straw at my lips, and I drank it\u2026 and was fine in about 15 minutes (the stuff is essentially liquid sugar). I remember it all quite clearly. MOST of the time, I\u2019m simply impatient\u2026 and I usually realise it right away, and treat it. BUT\u2026 when I\u2019m sleeping, I\u2019m not aware of it\u2026 until I\u2019m awakened; if I\u2019m too low, I\u2019ll be difficult and sometimes belligerent. Another experience from lows when sleeping is to \u201cwaken\u201d into a stuporous state\u2026 in which I\u2019ve suddenly realised the solution to some weighty problem (like the cure to Type 1 diabetes), with visions of how to effectuate it so everyone can be rid of it\u2026 but then, I can\u2019t find something that\u2019s needed, or figure out where it was\u2026 or some stupid issue like that. It\u2019s more a matter of being terribly confused and unable to sort it all out.\nHypoglycaemia is a very frustrating thing\u2026 as our BG levels drop, brain cells start dying off (at around 50 mg/dl), but more so, they\u2019re mis-firing, and our cognitive functions are out of order\u2026 and one of the first brain regions to be affected are the temporal lobes\u2026 where the seat of \u201cself control\u201d resides\u2026 the part of the brain that perceives what are and what are not socially acceptable behaviours. Hence the belligerence.\nOr at least, that\u2019s my story\u2026 and I\u2019m sticking to it\u2026 ;-)",

        "rating": "keep",
        "a_text": "The keto diet has exploded in popularity over the last few years, largely due to the substantial weight loss benefits associated with it. Since 40% of US adults over 20 years old are estimated to be obese, weight loss has become a major goal for the majority of the population. Controlling your diet is the single biggest thing you can do, to make a positive impact on your long-term health. By developing good habits, you are setting yourself up for a lifetime of optimal health.\nIn reality though, 10% of the US population suffers from diabetes, which is both a crippling condition in its own right, as well as an early warning sign of worse health problems to come. Diabetes causes high blood sugar, and needs to be treated with medication, so worse problems don\u2019t occur. Untreated diabetes can lead to organ problems, nerve issues, kidney problems, and even issues with your eyesight. Unsurprisingly, each person\u2019s A1c level (or long-term measurement of your blood sugar levels) is highly correlated with the risk for developing diabetes. The more sugar you take in on a daily basis, the more likely you are to develop diabetes. This is why the keto diet may be a great help for diabetes \u2013 it severely limits your carbohydrate and sugar intake.\nPreviously a niche problem, diabetes (especially type II) exploded into a full-blown health crisis in the United States. While the ever-increasing obesity rate gets a lot of press, the truth is diabetes is one of the biggest drivers behind obesity. In fact, many cases of insulin-resistance and type II diabetes go unreported. Not only can the keto diet help to manage diabetes, it is perhaps more valuable as a preventative strategy. Actually, you can adopt a keto diet before any problems arise and avoid developing diabetes or obesity. Since type II diabetes accounts for over 95% of all diabetes cases in the United States, avoiding development of the disease is huge scientific progress. Rather than relying on costly, after-the-fact medications, you can protect your good health by simply changing your diet.\nWhat Is A Normal Blood Sugar Range?\nFor those without diabetes, a normal blood sugar range is 100 mg/dL after not eating for eight hours, and less than 140 mg/dL two hours after eating. Consistent blood sugar readings that are greater than these ranges are highly problematic. Hyperglycemia is the medical term for blood sugar that is dangerously high, and if you continue to take in too much sugar on a daily basis, eventually you will develop serious problems with your blood sugar.\nWhat Are The Dangers Of High Blood Sugar?\nThere are both short-term, daily consequences to high blood sugar and long-term consequences. On a daily basis, you will need to start taking insulin. On a long-term basis, however, you will have to deal with diabetes, as well as all the negative consequences that come with it. If you suffer from diabetes, you will likely have low energy, constant hunger, excessive thirst, itchy skin, and a constant need to urinate. These symptoms should help scare you straight into keeping your blood sugar low.\nWhat Is Diabetes?\nDiabetes can simply be thought of as the malfunctioning of your body, when you consume too much sugar on a regular basis. When you have good health, your body produces insulin. Your pancreas releases it when you eat, and all remains well. But if you develop diabetes, your body starts to become resistant to insulin. This becomes problematic for a number of reasons, one of which is forcing your pancreas to work too hard. This causes damage to the cells in your pancreas, and eventually your pancreas may not be able to produce any insulin at all.\nType I Diabetes\nType I diabetes is a specific type of disease related to blood sugar regulation, but importantly, it\u2019s different than type II diabetes. Those suffering from this form of diabetes cannot produce any insulin at all, leaving them at a severe physical disadvantage. However, while type II diabetes is almost always caused by lifestyle, type I is genetic, and cannot be avoided. Sometimes type I diabetes is called juvenile diabetes, or insulin-dependent diabetes.\nIt\u2019s also important to distinguish between nutritional ketosis, and diabetic ketoacidosis. In nutritional ketosis, your ketone levels are elevated, but nothing else. This allows for your body to use stored fat for energy, and also helps to lower your insulin levels. Diabetic ketoacidosis, on the other hand, elevates your blood sugar and ketone levels, putting you in a very dangerous situation. While rare, it is still important to discuss starting a keto diet with your doctor, if you have any issues with blood sugar, so you avoid diabetic ketoacidosis.\nType II Diabetes\nType II diabetes is largely different than type I, as sufferers can usually still produce insulin. They are, however, hugely insulin resistant. There are a number of risk factors for developing type II diabetes, including inactivity, obesity, and too much sugar in the diet. Over 30 million people in the United States suffer from type II diabetes, even though it is largely avoidable. This is one of the many facts which show that the American diet has gone horribly off-track, and most people need to drastically alter their eating patterns. In fact, health experts estimate that by 2030, about 50% of the population in the US will be obese. Of those, most, if not all, will be suffering from type II diabetes.\nComplete Keto Diet Food List: What You Can and Cannot Eat If You're on a Ketogenic Diet - Click Here to Read",

But back to those who are less fortunate.\nClearly, if you have bad vascular disease, then impaired blood flow will make your feet chilly. In the severe cases I often see in hospital, the foot is often noticeably cold.\nBut diabetes can be more subtle in its effects, and one of these is related to the various neuropathies that occur. This has been studied rather a lot. Early work[1] showed that those with diabetic neuropathy have impaired temperature sensation\u2014they become fairly hopeless at detecting temperature changes, as demonstrated in the image above.\nSo their report of cold (or indeed warm) feet won\u2019t be reliable.\nThis is likely because it\u2019s the small fibres that transmit temperature sensation, and these are more affected in diabetes. Interestingly, more recent work has shown that the feet of those with diabetic neuropathy are often warmer:\nCorrelation between Plantar Foot Temperature and Diabetic Neuropathy: A Case Study by Using an Infrared Thermal Imaging Technique\nDiabetic neuropathy consists of multiple clinical manifestations of which loss of sensation is most prominent.

But adults can be diagnosed with it as well. It is not caused by lifestyle factors.\nIf Type 1 diabetics do not get insulin, they die. In order to be healthy and prevent early death, blindness, amputations, and kidney damage, they must test their blood glucose levels using test strips. These are expensive. They must check their blood glucose levels before and after meals, and before driving, as low blood sugars can cause confusion and unconsciousness.\nMy wife was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at age 8. Her parents were poor. So she had to ration her insulin, which was dangerous. Many times she suffered from hyperglycemia, or \u201chigh blood sugars.\u201d These can also cause death. Insulin is used to treat hyperglycemia. After she graduated college, she worked a few jobs which did not provide health insurance. She uses an insulin pump, which uses a type of insulin which is very expensive.\nShe tried to get Medicaid but at the time she didn\u2019t qualify because she didn\u2019t have children. This was before Obamacare. The government would only pay for her prescriptions if she was either blind or needed dialysis. So instead of helping people prevent kidney failure or blindness, public policy was to go the expensive route and wait until people are completely disabled and require hundreds of thousands of dollars in healthcare services instead of encouraging preventative medicine.\nEventually she found a job that did provide health insurance. I was paying for my own health insurance as a self-employed person but my costs were unaffordable as every year the amount went up by 20%. So after we married, I couldn\u2019t add her to my policy.\nThere are millions of diabetics who ration their insulin. Some of them die. Somehow the UK, Canada, the Nordic countries, and others can provide free or affordable insulin to their people, but the richest nation in the world cannot?\nIt can.

How does one gain muscles as a diabetic? - First I wonder diabetic what, and then what type. Assuming that you mean one of the 3 types of diabetic mellitus that are marked by glucoregulatory issues, the first thing is to do what is necessary to keep blood glucose levels close to the normal range. Part of this is exercise, but not all exercise is the same.\nIn my personal experience, aerobic/cardio exercise causes a steady drop in BG, while resistance exercise causes a rise. This is as one is exercising. Both are good for diabetics. But if lifting causes BG to rise how can it be good, you ask. Skeletal muscles act as a sink for glucose. They store it for later use. This helps to stabilize BG. Both type exercises increase insulin sensitivity.\nOne can gain muscle with any of the 3 main types of DM. One just has to pay more attention to diet, BG before and after exercise, and more.\nAs an elderly cyclist, my upper body strength has markedly declined. 3 years ago, I started working with a personal trainer. Thanks to her, I am more balanced, muscle wise. My arms, back, chest and core are much stronger, as well as improvement is my legs. We do 2 workouts per week while I cycle most every day.",

        "a_text": "Q: \u201cWhy does exercise not lower my blood sugar levels?\u201d\nIt does reduce your glucose levels; but you\u2019re likely not testing WHERE it does - and the FIRST thing that exercise does is RAISE your BG (Blood Glucose - the proper term for \u201cblood sugar\u201d) level.\nYour ENTIRE BODY is loaded with Glucose; not \u201cjust\u201d your blood, but your tissues and interstitial spaces (spaces between tissues) contain glucose; it is there for a reason - TO FUEL EVERY CELL OF YOUR BODY.\nEvery living cell MUST perform a function called cellular respiration; this is the process by which the cells generate the energy for life. They take in glucose and oxygen, oxidize (burn) the glucose (C6H12O6) in the oxygen (O2), thereby generating energy to live on, and cast off wastes (primarily carbon dioxide - CO2 - and water - H2O).\nWhen you initiate activity - you stimulate what is known as the \u201cfight or flight\u201d response. Now, you probably think of this as a threat response, and it is; but actually, it goes on ALL THE TIME - whenever you are active. Your liver stores glucose (in a denser, more stable form called glycogen), and when you begin to wake up - it releases it into the bloodstream as glucose again to \u201cprime the pump\u201d so you can hunt down and prepare breakfast\u2026 or, nowadays, stumble to the \u2018fridge and the coffeepot. ANY time you begin an activity, your liver pumps glucose into your bloodstream.\nBUT\u2026 that means you ARE reducing your overall body\u2019s glucose levels; but it\u2019s being \u201ctransferred\u201d out of the liver and long muscles, which also store it as glycogen. When long muscles are active, they use THIS glycogen preferentially over your BG - until the long-muscle stores are depleted, THEN you begin \u201cburning\u201d BG.\nIf the exercise session is short - your BG likely won\u2019t reduce noticeably; it will initially rise, then begin to drop to your normal resting level; but if you don\u2019t stay at it, it will not drop very much. BUT\u2026 you HAVE \u201cburned off\u201d lots of stored glucose.\nThe BETTER reason for regular exercise vis-a-vis BG levels is IMPROVED CELLULAR RESPONSE TO INSULIN. T2 (Type 2 DM - Diabetes Mellitus) is a disease of insulin resistance; the cells resist the primary action of insulin - which is to facilitate the transfer of glucose OUT of the bloodstream and into the cells; some cells don\u2019t need insulin to take up glucose - but most do. So when cells resist that transfer\u2026 too much glucose gets \u201cleft behind\u201d in the bloodstream - and the cells don\u2019t get the fuel they need as fast as they need it. This results in chronic fatigue, and for many, a sedentary lifestyle.\nBUT\u2026 if you exercise regularly (at least 4 or 5 days a week, never more than 2 days \u201coff\u201d in a row, and at least 35 or 30 minutes per day - more is better), your body\u2019s cells will become more insulin-receptive ALL THE TIME; this is why T2s (Type 2 DM patients) are advised to get regular exercise. What you\u2019re doing is less important than getting out and doing it; regular exercise of 150 minutes per week, spread over at least 4 days, DOES improve cellular response to insulin - ALL THE TIME.\nHere\u2019s a useful page on the subject from the endocrinologists (the docs that specialise in treating all types of \u201cdiabetes\u201d):\nhttps://www.endocrineweb.com/conditions/type-2-diabetes/type-2-diabetes-exercise\nI hope you found this helpful; and keep exercising!",

It\u2019s a mix of water and flour followed by a rest period of 30 minutes to an hour. Because it allows a portion of the flour to become saturated and allows the gluten strands to become stronger, it can help with the dough becoming more elastic, the crust looking better and having a better crisp, and there\u2019ll be more flavor development hopefully. No sugar needed at all.\nStarters are another way to avoid using any sugar. A pre-ferment or chef\u2019s starter is a reserve of the previous day\u2019s dough, yeast and all, that\u2019s been left to retard overnight in the walk-in. At home, it would be a much smaller portion. This won\u2019t be enough to make it taste like a sourdough, but it will give a loaf a great rise and there will be a much better flavor to your bread.\nSourdough starters are of course wonderful ways of getting great flavors in your breads as well as beautiful crusts and those glorious elastic breads. No sugar needed.\nThe addition of sugar to breads is actually fairly recent. It became popular in the 1900\u2019s as bread production on a large scale started. Breads needed to be produced quickly and neighborhood bakeries were hard pressed to keep up with factories making sliced bread for grocery stores popping up everywhere. Sugar added to the water and yeast helped to make the production of what we now call \u201cartisan breads\u201d go faster.\nIf you enjoy making bread that isn\u2019t made in a bread machine, there are many recipes that don\u2019t have sugar in them.

        "a_text": "It's perhaps a hypothetical debate when it comes to role of spicy foods in reducing risk of type II diabetes where there are many probability and constraints that shouldn't been undermined.Though as far as type II diabetes is concern its more scientifically evident that its onset and progression are interlinked to dietary habits it's glycemic index and physical activity of any healthier subjects where the risk calculator is kept to predict future risk.Thus one conclusion can be drawn that diet which contributes more sugar and calories can be precursor of its early onset which corelates to spicy diet that is more delicious form of food weither it's veggie or non veggies but people do enjoy such diet irresistible because of processing of food which is makes it more edible and increasesignal it's uptake by everyone.This is further more augmented in terms of its health benefits which increases because of its easy digestion to provide a relaxing sleep.Therefore I feel spicy diet cannot be effective for reducing risk of type II diabetes for veggie subjects.Bit for non veggies it's goat's flesh or lamb which had some glucose lowering benefits to reduce risk of type II diabetes.",

        "a_text": "Q: \u201cWhat are the long-term effects of type 2 diabetes?\u201d\nI PRESUME you mean type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2). Be aware - there are THREE types of DM (Diabetes Melltius), and FOUR types of DI (Diabetes Insipidus). But T2 DM is the most common.\nDI and DM are COMPLETELY DIFFERENT groups of diseases; DI diseases involve a lack of, or poor storage of, or poor response to the hormone vasopressin, the fluid-balance regulating hormone. DM diseases involve a lack of, or poor response to, the BG (Blood Glucose) regulating hormone insulin.\nThe long-term effects of T2 are IDENTICAL to the long-term effects of ALL THREE DM diseases (autoimmune T1, and pancreatogenic T3c are the other two types of DM).\nThe long-term effects range from NONE AT ALL, to TOTAL ORGAN DESTRUCTION AND FAILURE. Where a patient falls on that spectrum depends ENTIRELY on how well they control their BG levels. Here\u2019s a little outline I wrote for a similar query.\n\u201cDiabetes Mellitus Complications outline\nDM refers to one of THREE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT DISEASES (each with sub-types) that cause elevated BG (Blood Glucose) levels; if those levels are allowed to remain elevated too high and for too long, THAT in turn causes SEVERE DAMAGE to the body\u2019s vasculature and organs, which causes all the nasty \u201ccomplications\u201d that DM is known for - and this applies to ALL THREE types of DM. It\u2019s the elevated BG that causes \u201ccomplications\u201d, and that happens in all of them.\nThe first and most noticeable damages are to the blood vessels and nerves; these add to the damage, and lead to damage to EVERY TISSUE IN THE BODY.\nTo start\u2026 when BG is elevated, excess AGES are created - Advanced Glycation End productS. These AGES are created when the haemoglobin glycates - which means binds chemically to portions of the glucose molecules in the bloodstream. AGES are a sort of by-product of that process. AGES are a sticky-sweet \u201cgunk\u201d that build up in the bloodstream, but as they are distributed throughout the body, they adhere to, smother, and kill the cells of the tissue they come into contact with - which is EVERY cell of the body, ultimately; here\u2019s an article focused on the vasculature: The Role of Advanced Glycation End Products in Diabetic Vascular Complications\nAND\u2026 when BG is elevated, endothelial cells\u2019 glucose metabolism is increased, and the enzyme hexokinase 2 (HK2) degrades more slowly, leading to endothelial cell dysfunction.. and problems: How Does Hyperglycemia Cause Damage And What Can We Do To Avoid It?\nSO\u2026 those are the underlying biochemical issues; here\u2019s a little intro to the \u201ccomplications\u201d of DM - which are ALL caused by elevated BG; this one outlines HOW MUCH those complications occur: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/GetPdf.cgi?id=phd000390\nHypertension is among the first \u201ccomplications\u201d to appear; the immediate damage to the vasculature causes elevated BP (Blood Pressure), which is hypertension if it becomes prolonged. This, in turn. leads to CVD and heart problems, often resulting in heart disease and failure.\nMeanwhile, neuropathies (there are seven types of neuropathy) will cause damage to the nerves; peripheral neuropathy is the most common of these, but by no means the most damaging. ALL nerves are subject to neuropathy (nerve damage), and when damaged - your body is unaware of injury or issues, and you can lose muscle control, as well as autonomic functions (digestion and so on). Most folks focus on peripheral neuropathy, which can cause loss of feeling in the limbs (feet-toes/hands-fingers), leading to infections, gangrene and amputations; but you can also lose the ability to digest foods, vision may become impaired, sexual function may be impaired (in both men and women), muscles may fail, skin may become dry and flaky, and hair may fall out - and these are just some of the issues caused by the different types of neuropathy.\nNephropathy is another major issue for DM patients - this is damage to the nephrons of the kidneys. This, in turn, causes CKD - Chronic Kidney Disease, and ultimately, renal failure; this is why so many diabetics need dialysis.\nAnd the lists go on\u2026 elevated BG levels are BAD\u2026 and cause damage to ALL of the body\u2019s tissues and organs. This is why good BG control is so important to us.\u201d",

I am leaning towards a plant based diet and intermittent fasting, does that sound right?\u201d\nNo, that sounds dead wrong\u2026 literally. There are REAL science-based guidelines available to manage T2 (Type 2 DM - Diabetes Mellitus). Fads are NOT a good idea.\nRather than a \u201cplant based\u201d diet - learn to count and control carb intake. Rather than fasting - get REGULAR exercise of AT LEAST 150 minutes per week, with no more than 2 days \u201coff\u201d during the week.\nFollowing is an outline of T2, with several excellent links and resources that will help you learn how to manage YOUR T2 - and KNOW THIS: each patient is DIFFERENT; what \u201cworks\u201d for one will NOT work for another; we\u2019re each a unique biochemical machine, and must tailor our treatment to our circumstances and biochemical response to foods, activity, and meds.\nHere\u2019s a little T2 Primer:\n\u201cT2 is an hereditary disease (meaning it's not only genetic, but often transferred from one generation to the next - though that's not a \"requirement\") caused by a certain combination of genetic alleles that cause a biochemical problem called IR - Insulin Resistance. In short - although your pancreas produces all the insulin you should need - your body's cells don't respond to it efficiently. Insulin's job is to transfer glucose (a simple form of sugar, and the only kind your body can use to fuel its cells) from the bloodstream (your body's \"delivery system\") into those cells. When the cells resist insulin's action - they don't get the fuel they need, and too much sugar gets \"left behind\" in your bloodstream - leading to the first and primary symptom, elevated BG (Blood Glucose). Elevated BG leads to the typical early symptoms of polydipsia (excessive thirst), polyurea (frequent urination), fatigue, polyphagia (prolonged hunger), blurry vision, and easy weight gain. Most T2s have elevated BG for a while before the symptoms are severe enough to go to the doc and get it dx'd (diagnosed).\nIn response to the cellular IR - your pancreas starts overproducing insulin. At first - this works, and your BG stays in \"normal\" range (about 90 to 120 mg/dl all day long, with 80% of the day spent below 100 mg/dl). BUT... in time, your pancreas can no longer make enough \"extra\" insulin, and BG levels climb - and that's when folks get dx'd. But in all likelihood - your pancreas is still producing \"more than normal\" amounts of insulin - but the cellular resistance to it is too much, and that's why your BG is still too high.\nThis is where the \"lifestyle changes\" come in. For a long time, docs have been blaming T2s for giving themselves the disease by overeating and not getting enough exercise. THAT is a LIE. You don't get the disease without the genetic markers....and there are lots of overweight lazy people that do NOT have T2. There are over 80 genetic anomalies associated with T2, but there are so far THREE that are absolutely confirmed as causative. All three are located near IRS1 (Insulin Receptor Substrate 1) on chromosome 2 of the human genome; these are SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) rs2943650, rs2943634, and rs2972146. These all cause the underlying biochemical issue of IR\u2026 but also, they pre-dispose the carrier to a tendency to gain weight easily, and fatigue readily.\nBy eating a proper diet and getting regular physical activity, you CAN improve (for some, even \"normalise\") your BG levels. Here's why.\nThe glucose in your bloodstream comes primarily from the carbohydrates you eat. When talking about a \"proper\" diet - we're talking about limiting carbs to a level your body can handle. The less glucose there is in your bloodstream, the better your body can transfer it to the cells. HOW MUCH to limit carbs is DIFFERENT FOR EVERYONE - which is why there are so many different approaches to meal planning for T2s. The \"trick\" is to learn what works for you. A gentleman named Alan Shanley has an excellent website that covers everything you need to know about this... and the primary thing you need to start is learning to count carbs, and testing your BG regularly to learn how many carbs your system can tolerate at each meal. So I'm going to give you some links to pages you should read on these subjects:\nCarb counting for beginners: https://www.bd.com/resource.aspx?IDX=9829\nCarbs by foods: http://www.med.umich.edu/1libr/MEND/CarbList.pdf\nIf your doc hasn't suggested a meter - ask for a script so you can get one through your insurance, or just go to any major pharmacy and get one of their own brand; Walmart has them for about $10 (the meter will last for several years, with a few battery changes), with strips (you need a new strip for each test) for 18 cents apiece. Docs often don't think T2's need meters - but you DO. Without testing, you have no idea what your meals and exercise are doing to your BG levels.\nCGMs (Continuous Glucose Monitors) are an alternate way of following your BG levels; these devices measure interstitial fluid - constantly. they are a \u201clag indicator\u201d of BG - but reliable for following your BG fluctuations, and a wealth of information; but they are less readily available to T2s due to insurance limitations.\nHere are some important resources:\nFrom Alan's site:\nGetting Started: Getting Started\nTesting with purpose (use your meter to control BG): Test, Review, Adjust\nTarget BG levels: Blood Glucose Targets\nSo... that covers most of the dietary issues - on to 'exercise\". The reason exercise (by which we mean ANY form of regular physical activity) is important is that active cells are insulin-receptive cells. Meaning when you get regular physical activity (running, walking, swimming, bicycling - ANYTHING you enjoy and can stick to) at least 4 or 5 days a week for at least 35 or 30 minutes each day, you are improving your body's cellular response to insulin - making the insulin your body is already making more effective. If you aren't accustomed to regular activity - start with something you like for short durations, and work up over time. It's very beneficial. You'll also read about exercise lowering BG by \"burning off\" the glucose - which it does... BUT... that's only for as long as you're exercising. The REAL benefit is from the improvement in your cellular response to insulin, which, once you're getting in regular activity, remains all the time - NOT just when you're being active. Here\u2019s a useful page from the endocrinology website (endocrinologists are the docs that specialize in treating diabetics): Type 2 Diabetes and Exercise\nAnother excellent site on all types of DM \u2013 here\u2019s the page on T2: Type 2 Diabetes :: Diabetes Education Online\nOn T2 medications - KNOW THIS - all T2 oral meds REQUIRE the use of \"diet and exercise\" to be effective (read the fine print in the paperwork that comes with it). The standard starting T2 med is met, or metformin. This med does NOT actually lower BG - what it does is inhibit your body from raising your BG, which is a normal part of the glucose balance system that keeps non-D's (non-Diabetic's) BG in the 90 to 120 mg/dl range. By dulling this side of the body's response - the met is keeping your BG from getting too high too often. It's the \"diet and exercise\" that control the glucose you get from eating. Also - for many people, met needs to be taken for a couple of weeks before it starts having an effect on BG. Met also slows absorption of glucose from the foods you eat (a bit), and improves cellular response to insulin - a TINY bit.\nWhy is keeping BG as close to \"normal\" as possible important? Because elevated BG levels are what cause all the nasty complications of D - vascular damage leading to CVD and atherosclerosis, and retinopathy leading to blindness, and nephropathy leading to kidney failure, nerve damage leading to neuropathy and loss of limbs, and so on. BUT... it's not the high BG alone that does this - high BG leads to high HbA1c levels - you may have had a test referred to as an A1c test; this is a measure of the percentage of your haemoglobin that has glycated, which means bound chemically to the sugar in your blood (glucose). When that chemical binding happens - AGES are created (Advanced Glycation End productS), and it's ultimately these AGES that do the damage - they're a sticky-sweet \"gunk\" that adheres to, covers and smothers the tissue of the vasculature and organs, slowly killing them off (leading to the various \"complications\" along the way). A non-diabetic's HbA1c level ranges from 3.5% to 5.5%. The most extensive study of complications in diabetics (DCCT/EDIC studies) found that those that maintain an HbA1c level of NO MORE than 6.5% suffer the least amount of these \"complications\". For every point above 5.5%, the risk for those complications goes up about 30% (NIH ADVANCE collaborative group).\nBesides AGES, there is also a chemical reaction to elevated BG in the endothelial cells; this also contributes to the malfunctioning of those cells, and the damage that leads to complications\u2026 especially vascular degradation.\nFinally, for those with \u201cpre-diabetes\u201d\u2026 here\u2019s a good intro from NIH on how to prevent the onset of full-blown T2, geared to those with high risk factors for it - and those with \u201cpre-diabetes\u201d (a condition akin to being \u201ca little bit pregnant\u201d):\nPreventing Type 2 Diabetes | NIDDK\nLearn how you can prevent type 2 diabetes, such as losing weight by being active and eating low-calorie, low-fat foods, or taking the diabetes drug metformin.\nhttps://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/preventing-type-2-diabetes\nAnother site on prevention, from the ADA:\nRisk Test | ADA\nAmerican Diabetes Association 2451 Crystal Drive, Suite 900 Arlington, VA 22202 For donations by mail: P.O.

        "a_text": "\u201cWhat is a good meal plan for a type 2 diabetic bodybuilder?\u201d\nThe first thing I recommend is to read Plant-Based Athlete: A Game-Changing Approach to Peak Performance by Matt Frazier and Robert Cheeke. (Just releasted) Many athletes have taken this approach to world class status. The Tennessee Titans have done this as have Vanessa and Serena Williams and numerous other world class athletes. A very entertaining education in this matter would be from following this link to\nThe Game Changers movie.\nHowever, your main concern is T2 diabetes as that will likely knock years off your life and may well make a good number of those years miserable from the resulting co-morbidities. I would assume you are taking no insulin. If so then you have a very good chance of completely reversing your diabetes since your beta cells still work, more than likely they are overworked. If you are taking insulin you can still make dramatic improvements.\nT2 diabetes is simply a state of insulin resistance caused primarily by \u201cthe interplay between branched chain amino acids and staturated fatty acids\u201d. (the quote is from an ariticle by Christopher Newgard, Director, Duke Molecular Physiology Institute and Sarah W. Stedman Nutrition and Metabolism Center) T2 diabetes can frequently be eliminated entirely as did NYC mayor Eric Adams by eliminating all animal products (the source for excess branched chain amino acids), added fats especially saturated fats and most processed food. You should check out his book about his experience, Healthy at Last.\nAdams\u2019 experience is particularly interesting in that when he was diagnosed, he had vision impairment from the early stages of diabetes. This was from osmotic pressures due to very high blood sugar causing a swelling of the cells lining the blood vessels. (the endothelium). Good control will usually reverse this if permanent damage has not been done. Eventually though even low levels of hyperglycemia will result in the accumulation of advanced glycation end products. They will become part of numerous structures ranging from your blood vessels (resulting in CVD) to your lenses. (resulting in diabetic cateracts) These AGEs function much like senescent cells contributing to systemic inflammation stiffness and longer term diabetic morbidities including heart attack, stroke, neuropathy, nephropathy et al.\nFinally I should say that being a body builder is a great activity to help with the diabetes reversal. Using all muscles helps improve inulin sensitivity. So inevitably the question arises \u201cwhat about the protein?\u201d First it\u2019s a mystery to my as to just how \u201cbro-science\u201d has made this non issue such an obsession. We normally need less than .8g protein per kg healthy body weight. That is the average needed plus 2 standard deviations to make sure everyone is covered. But that is more than most people need. I get that without trying. The sources include greens, beans, grains, roots and mushrooms. All are good sources of protein and,,,, you can even get a little from apples. Just keep in mind, the strongest largest primates (gorillas) are plant based in their diet.\nAs a body builder you will need extra protein just as I as an active 71 year old man do. For you this will be easy as you can keep a consistent healthy diet but just eat more of the same. Therefore you will be getting more protein. In any case tests have shown that vegans tend to have slightly higher blood protein levels than omnivores. So it is not an issue if you consume adequate calories.\nSo a good meal plan would be to consume mostly complex carbohydrates, greens, fruit mushrooms, whole grains, and lots of beans.\nMy breakfast as a T1 diabetic is a mixed grains a lentils bowl with various fruits. I also include a lot of spices and coco powder. Lunch will be a sandwich with whole grain bread with greens, hummus, a bean burger and pickles. Dinner is more often than not mixed steamed veggies with an oriental sauce covering them. In general though without writing a cook book I could not give much of a \u201cmeal plan\u201d per se. It is for that reason that I cited the two books by Frazier and Cheeke on athletic endevour with a healthy diet, and Adams reversing T2 diabetes. They both include showing meal plans in a variety of contexts that can eliminate the T2 diabetes and give you a major advantage in your athletic endevours whether as a body builder, a football player or a marathon runner.\nFinally, Good Luck.",

My diabetes improved so amazingly much when I started ADHD meds because I started remembering to take my meds, take my insulin, test my sugar, had the impulse control to not eat as much junk food, etc.\nI strongly recommend:\nSet alarms on your phone to REMIND YOU TO EAT! Stimulants are appetite suppressants, you just won\u2019t be hungry, and without that \u201coh I am hungry\u201d cue from your body, you just don\u2019t think about eating.\nIt\u2019s very very easy to have sugar crashes on stimulants because of this. You may also need some adjustments to your insulin quantities and scheduling because of your stimulant use.\nAs a type 1 diabetic myself, I strongly recommend that you see a endocrinologist (diabetes doctor) as well as your psychiatrist when you start ADHD medication. Even though there are no DIRECT interactions, as you can see from this post, there are A LOT of indirect interactions. A type 1 diabetic, in my opinion, NEEDS to have more then just a GP (family doctor) involved when starting ADHD medication.\nMetta.\nThis is NOT medical advice! This is my own personal experiences, I am not a medical practitioner. Please talk to your DOCTOR for medical advice.",

THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO with \u201cgetting worse\u201d, or developing \u201ccomplications\u201d, or anything like that; it is PURELY a biological fact that as the pancreatic endocrine beta cells wear out, and cellular resistance to insulin increases, the disease \u201cprogresses\u201d - along the aetiological lines that are WELL ESTABLISHED as the disease progression.\nOver time, BG (Blood Glucose) levels increase because the insulin doesn\u2019t work as it should, and vasculature (the blood vessel system) deteriorates - primarily seen in hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis) evidenced by hypertension (increased blood pressure). Many other problems may develop - and ALL are related to the elevated BG levels; but that is NOT what is meant by the \u201cprogressive\u201d nature of the disease.\nThe disease is GENETIC - without the genetic markers, you don\u2019t develop it. BUT\u2026 even WITH the genetic markers - you do NOT have to develop it - or let it \u201cprogress\u201d. A carb-limited diet, and regular daily exercise, WILL slow the progression - and if begun early enough, can prevent it from developing at all.\nCellular resistance to insulin means that the glucose your cells need doesn\u2019t get into them as fast or as completely as it should. That means too much glucose is \u201cleft behind\u201d in your bloodstream - and THAT is what causes all the nasty \u201ccomplications\u201d of DM.\nThe PRIMARY means of improving cellular response to insulin is EXERCISE; you\u2019ll hear people say that exercise lowers BG by \u201cburning off\u201d the glucose, and it does - but the PRIMARY benefit of REGULAR exercise is that it makes the body\u2019s cells MORE RECEPTIVE to insulin - and NOT \u201cjust\u201d when you\u2019re active; if you exercise REGULARLY (at least 5 days a week, at least 30 minutes a day - more is better) your cellular sensitivity to insulin remains with you ALL THE TIME - even if you\u2019re not exercising. And THAT is the BEST way to STOP the progression of the disease. ): httphttp://s://www.endocrineweb.com/conditions/type-2-diabetes/type-2-diabetes-exercise\nBy limiting carbs - you put less stress on the insulin-producing pancreatic endocrine beta cells, thereby sparing them the need to constantly over-produce insulin - and thereby helping them function longer and more efficiently. Combined with regular exercise - this is a MAJOR improvement in BG control, and if begun early, it can forestall progression from \u201cpre-diabetes\u201d to full-blown diabetes, and if one is a full-blown diabetic - it will slow the ongoing progression. MANY T2s manage their BG with \u201conly\u201d diet (carb limitation) and exercise (a REGULAR regimen).\nHere\u2019s some links to pages on forestalling the progression from pre- to -diabetic.\nHere\u2019s a good intro from NIH on how to prevent the onset of full-blown T2, geared to those with high risk factors for it - and those with \u201cpre-diabetes\u201d (a condition akin to being \u201ca little bit pregnant\u201d): Preventing Type 2 Diabetes | NIDDK\nAnother site on prevention, from the ADA: Risk Test | ADA\nAnother from Mayo Clinic: Diabetes prevention: 5 tips for taking control\nA final one from the endocrinologists: Type 2 Diabetes Prevention: Here's What You Can Do",

What that means, biochemically, is a cellular resistance to the action of insulin.\nInsulin\u2019s job is to facilitate the transfer of glucose from the bloodstream (the body\u2019s delivery and waste removal system) into the cells - which NEED it for fuel. When those cells resist that transfer - too much glucose gets \u201cleft behind\u201d in the bloodstream, and too little gets into the cells.\nIn an effort to overcome that resistance - the body produces MORE insulin - and that works\u2026 for a while, until it doesn\u2019t. T2 is a \u201cprogressive\u201d disease - meaning, the insulin resistance of the cells increases all the time, and eventually, the body can\u2019t produce enough \u201cextra\u201d insulin to overcome the cellular resistance - and that\u2019s when the symptoms start.\nIF a person is overweight - that will mean MORE insulin is needed; insulin need STARTS with total weight - every cell must have insulin, so the more you weigh, the more insulin you need. BUT\u2026 the same alleles that cause insulin resistance ALSO cause obesity - so in fact, being overweight is a SYMPTOM of T2 - NOT the cause. The other two factors oft cited as \u201ccauses\u201d are over-consumption of carbohydrates, and a sedentary lifestyle. BUT\u2026 as T2 develops, people feel hungry longer than they \u201cshould\u201d, because the cells aren\u2019t getting the benefit of the glucose the patient is producing\u2026 AND\u2026 T2 itself causes fatigue - leading the patient to engage in a more sedentary lifestyle.\nAs the disease progresses, the constant state of hyperinsulinemia (the body is always awash in insulin) causes degradation and loss of endocrine beta cell mass and functionality - leading the long-term T2 to lose insulin production capacity; it is in this phase that T2s may start to need insulin like T1s.\nAlso\u2026 there are lots of obese folks that do NOT have T2 - and THAT is because there\u2019s a T2 allele that PROTECTS against T2 - but causes obesity.\nFor more in-depth reading on the topic - here\u2019s some sources:\n\u201cGenetic Variant Near IRS1 Is Associated with Type 2 diabetes, Insulin Resistance, and Hyperinsulinemia\u201d, Nature Genetics, 2009\n\u201cGenetic Variation Near IRS1 Associated with Adiposity and a Favourable Metabolic Profile\u201d, Kilpelainen et al, Nature Genetics, 2011\n\u201cNew Genes Hold Clue to Why Many With Obesity Don\u2019t Get Diabetes\u201d, Becky McCall, Medscape 3/19/18\n\u201cThe Genetic Architecture of Type 2 Diabetes\u201d, Fuchsberger, et al.

If I had diabetes, I would want the \u201cbestest\u201d drug out there too.\nTo begin we will need to define what \u201cbest\u201d mean. To me, it would be something with the highest efficacy, safest track record and if possible, won\u2019t cost a bomb.\nIf that\u2019s your criteria, then metformin is your answer. Metformin has been used to treat diabetes in humans since 1950s and is safe enough to be given to pregnant mothers with diabetes. It is also known to be one of the most effective in reducing blood sugar (about 1.5% HbA1c on average), and is DIRT CHEAP. You can get it for about 10 cents per tablet in Malaysia.\nBut\u2026is it the best FOR YOU?\nNot necessarily. As a rule shared by all medicine, there are many conditions which might make metformin UNSUITABLE for you. For instance, if you have compromised kidney functions, a very sensitive gut that is not agreeable with metformin, or you have other factors predisposing you to acidosis.\nThat is why we don\u2019t just hit everybody with metformin. How good if it were that simple! This is also why we have medical guidelines setup by international experts, to aid in choosing the best treatment for each individual patient.\nYour doctor is always the best person to help you decide which treatment is most suitable for you, as treatment options need to be individualised. If for some reason you have doubt on what your doctor has told you, the best thing is to seek a second opinion from another qualified doctor.\nThe WORST thing you can do is to start hunting for miracle treatments, because you will inevitably end up in the various traps set by unscrupulous businessmen trying to earn a quick buck. People with chronic diseases will always be their number one target, as EVERYBODY wants a quick fix.\nHope that helped",

In 1979, the National Diabetes Data Group formally created prediabetes as a diagnostic category. Prediabetes is meant to identify those at high risk for developing future Type 2 Diabetes (T2DM). Eighteen years later, in 1997, the American Diabetes Association revised its criteria for the diagnosis of T2DM and high-risk individuals and created a new category called \u201cimpaired fasting glucose\u201d, (IFG). IFG identified as \u201cPrediabetic,\u201d those whose fasting plasma glucose (FPG) was high.\nClassifying \u201cPrediabetic,\u201d those with a FPG of 100\u2013125mg/dl, (5.6\u20137.8mmol), was thought to save time and resources. Instead of performing the more time-consuming (2 to 3 hour) and expensive oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), a single FPG was conceived as a test which could identify those at high-risk for developing T2DM. Never mind that the FBG varies for a multitude of reasons which we will cover shortly. (Ex. Don\u2019t get tested after a bout of insomnia.)\nLater in 2003 the ADA lowered their fasting blood glucose diagnostic threshold for prediabetes from 110 mg/dL to 100 mg/dL. Unbudgingly, the WHO has steadfastly kept the original 110 mg/dL cutoff. That 10 mg/dL difference makes a huge difference in the number labeled prediabetic.\nThe ADA\u2019s lower FBG threshold means that many more people will fall into the prediabetes category. While capturing more prediabetics, the lower threshold misidentifies a larger number as at risk for diabetes, when they weren\u2019t.\nThe most clearly mislabeled group are those with high FBG, normal two hour GTT values and low insulin resistance, typically middle-aged athletes.",

This may be due to a genetic defect, viral infection, severe psychic, mental or emotional trauma. This form of diabetes tends to occur in thin, sensitive, intelligent people.The medical treatment consists of daily injections of replacement insulin.\nSecond one is more common form is called maturity onset diabetes which develops gradually in middle aged, stressed, overweight, under exercised persons, whose diet contains an excess of sugars, starches and fats. This long term overloading of the digestive system, especially the pancreas, leads to progressive deterioration of the insulin secreting mechanism and sensitivity of the body tissues to the insulin. In the initial stage it can be controlled by dietary restrictions alone. But in later stages oral drugs and then insulin injection required for the rest of his life.\nWhatever the cause, the main features of Diabetes is the excessive sugar in the blood and its passing out with the urine of the patients. This is due to malfunction of the pancreas. It's symptoms are frequent urination, gets excessive thirst, tiredness, loss of weight, weakness in vision, skin disorder etc. After a time being high blood pressure and kidney disorder also happens.\nYOGIC TREATMENT:\nApana mudra: Bend the ring and middle finger by pressing the thumb of both palm for 15 minutes twice a day with chanting r-a-m.\nIt regulates Diabetes, piles, Constipation, toxin of urine, eyes, liver, gall bladder and give self confidence, patience and harmony.\nSurya Namaskara Asana, Bhujangasana, Shalbhasana, Uttanpadasana, Pawanmuktasana, Sarvangasa, Matsyasna, Dhanurasana, Shavasana and Pranayama .\nAsana should be practiced according to his/ her comfort level. Within one or two month endocrine gland will start it's normal function and disease will subside. Now patient can add more asanas in its day to day life.\nACUPRESSURE:\nDeep pressure on your palm twice a day for two minutes. Pain will be found in a particular point, press it again for two minutes to remove the toxin. Pressure on the wrist is also required and press at the middle of palm (at last). It is essential to remove the toxin from kidney.\nHOMEOPATHY:\nSyzygium jambolanum tincture: ten drops thrice a day in little water in all cases of Diabetes.\nUranium nitrate 3x- two to three grains mor/evening is good for diabetic patients. by Dr.Bradford.\nNatrum sulph 6x- three globules twice a day before meals.\nNatrum phos 6x- three globules twice a day after meals.\nNOTE:\nDrink charged water where eight glasses reduced in two glasses with a coin of gold, silver, copper and iron. Tension should be removed by pressing all the toes and fingers in backward direction for two minutes.\nDrink half glass coriander leaves juice early in the morning for one/two months. Take your breakfast after half an hour.\nAll these medicines are sufficient for diabetic patient. It is necessary to chew food properly. Saliva can be properly mixed up with the food and make it easily digestible. Avoid fried, fatty, spicy, starchy and sugar containing food for two to three months. They should avoid potatoes, bananas, mangoes and those fruits in which percentage of sugar are high. They should take Guava ,apple, lemon, papaya, radish(mooli), bel, brinjal, bitter gourd (karela) and blackberry (jamun). Sprouts and nuts should also included in diet. Germinated grams, whole wheat bread or chapati, Dalia, corn flakes, pulses(moong, massor, chana), salad, soup, green or leafy vegetables, one or two cup tea or coffee can be included in diet. Drink two to three cups of green juice adding Amla, ginger black pepper etc.\nWithin fifteen days the positive effect will be seen. Now reduce your medicine or injection. Within one or two month diabetes will be in control. Swimming, walking and yogasana are good exercises. Now forget your ailment and live a happy and healthy life.\n\u201c",

I'm sure it's relatively easy to \"switch off\" the chemical releasing, but getting the claws off will likely be hard using genetic engineering, since such morphological features are either formed by genes that have functions elsewhere, so you can't just knock them out. And without the claws, they can't attach themselves to the intestinal wall; I guess if they're sterilised (which they must be in any medical use), then it's relatively okay (I doubt that they can cause haemorrhaging).\nEvolution. It isn't predictable, and it's unstoppable, no matter how much GM you do. Say you have a population of worms, all thriving on this sugar diet. Natural selection dictates that if they're thriving, they won't change diet. After reproduction time, an individual arises with a mutation that allows it to also eat flesh. Extreme example, but you get my point :) There is no way you can control for that, unless you stop them from reproducing. Which would mean two things: the patient must always get new worms implanted every xx days (depending on the lifespan of the worm), and that the same stock colony of worms must be kept in a lab, reproducing by cloning, and each different genotype produced during reproduction (since there are never, ever any perfect clones) must be tested for possible adverse effects as a matter of principle and probably of law. I can't imagine this would be cheap for either patient or drug company.",

And, back in the days before we knew much about anatomy, physiology, genetics and biochemistry and their links to disease pathology we only really knew about the observed symptoms.\nSo, Diabetes Mellitus. The Greek of the name can be translated as \u2018Fountain of Honey' and it was a poetic way of describing the excessive, sweet flavoured urine that patients produced. Ancient scholars like Areteus of Cappadocia noted this symptom and applied the name without realising that there were multiple diseases with similar symptoms.\nIt was only later, in the Middle Ages, that some Arabic physicians noted the different types and it's not clear if they observed this themselves or were reporting older observations that had been lost to history. They identified \u2018old, fat' Diabetes and \u2018young, thin' Diabetes. The basis of the more modern type 2 and 1 classification. But even they didn't understand the reasons.\nAs time went on, we began to understand the differences on pathology. We also started (by the 1980s) to realise that some type 2s can be young and some type 1s can develop old and being overweight isn't necessary to get type 2. This was the point where we ditched the older \u2018IDDM\u2019 and \u2018NIDDM' terms and things like \u2018Juvenile onset\u2019 and \u2018Maturity onset' in favour of the less confusing type 1 and type 2. This mainly driven by the realisation that terms like \u2018Marurity Onset Diabetes of the Young\u2019 were just stupid.\nSo, it's now clear that type 1 and type 2 are actually completely different disorders with different risk factors and pathology. Had they been discovered and identified today they would more likely be noted differently based on that pathology.\ne.g. Autoimmune Pancreatic Deficiency Disorder (Type 1)\nProgressive Insulin Resistance Syndrome (type 2) but only because we can then call it PIRS.\nBut we're stuck with the Fountain of Honey because the dude who named it had no idea how the endocrine and immune systems worked and was weirdly obsessed with tasting his patients\u2019 wee.

        "a_text": "Most diabetics know to avoid sugar. It only makes sense: if your blood sugar is too high you shouldn't complicate the situation by ingesting more of the same.\nBut sugar in your diet is not the only food that will raise your blood glucose. Carbohydrates and alcohol raise your blood sugar (blood glucose level) about as quickly as eating sugar straight from the bowl. Proteins and fat are converted into energy for the body as well but don't raise the blood sugar nearly as much nor nearly as quickly.\nOf course, sugar in the blood is not exactly the same as sugar in your food. The human body uses glucose as its energy source. Table sugar is sucrose, fruit sugar is fructose, and milk sugar is lactose. There are other sugars as well, but basically these sugars are converted to glucose in the human body.\nNot everyone has a sweet tooth, but I certainly do. It goes without saying (but I'll say it anyway) that diabetics should avoid eating anything made with sugar or high-fructose corn syrup including: candy, cake, cookies, ice cream, donuts, marshmallow cream, circus peanuts, soda pop, Kool-aid, sports drinks, sweet tea or fruit drinks, hot chocolate, caramel corn, candy corn, jello, pudding, Popsicles, sherbet, syrup, whipped cream, pie, Cracker Barrel chocolate cake, custard, jelly, Nutella, milkshakes, Captain Crunch, etc. If I missed your favorite, add it to the list.\nThe following 10 foods should be avoided as well.\n1. White bread. The processed flour turns to glucose almost as quickly as sugar itself. In fact, white bread is rated the same as glucose on the glycemic index. The glycemic index is a ranking according to how quickly a particular food raises blood glucose levels. High is bad, low is good. Both glucose and white bread are rated 100. Stone-ground whole wheat bread and pumpernickel bread have a much lower glycemic index.\n2. White bagels. They look a lot like white bread, don't they? The yummy bagels are much higher in calories than regular bread, too. Two slices of bread equals about 150 calories whereas a good-sized bagel is twice that. Not that you can't eat bagels, but get a whole-grain variety and remember that eating a big bagel is like eating 4 slices of toast.\n3. Saltine crackers. If you were the baker, you'd notice that white bread, white bagels, and crackers all start off with white flour. The same is true of standard pretzels. Whole grain crackers and pretzels are better for diabetics and non-diabetics alike.\n4. White potatoes. Strangely, sweet potatoes have a lower glyemic index and raise the blood sugar less than white potatoes do.\n5. White rice. Are you noticing a pattern here? Some diabetic patients choose to avoid anything white.\n6. Most breakfast cereal. Unless it's made with whole grains, breakfast cereal, too, will be processed like sugar. Even quick oatmeal raises blood sugar. Stone-cut oatmeal is much better for you and is now available in standard grocery stores, right next to the \"regular\" oatmeal. However, the stone-cut variety takes much longer to cook, easily half an hour or more to soften the grain to the consistency of regular oatmeal.\n7. Instant pasta or macaroni mixes. Almost anything \"instant\" or processed breaks down into sugar more quickly than the natural forms.\n8. Popcorn. Yes, another white item - however, amount is the key. A cup of popcorn (unbuttered) won't raise your blood sugar much whereas eating a large theater popcorn is like eating a few candy bars.\n9. Sweet fruits. The especially sweet fruits like watermelon and pineapple contain more fruit-sugar than the less sweet fruits, but again, amount is the key. A few bites won't hurt you.\n10. Alcohol. Not only does it elevate your blood sugar, but it may impair your judgment regarding your diabetes. Best to avoid this altogether.",

        "a_text": "How does diarrhea affect people with diabetes? If you have diabetes, you may experience diarrhea when you eat certain foods or when your blood sugar is too high or too low. When you have diabetic diarrhea, there\u2019s more to it than the uncomfortable feeling and embarrassing moments in public restrooms. Diabetic diarrhea can lead to dehydration and malnutrition, which can be life-threatening if left untreated. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to understand what causes diabetic diarrhea, as well as how to treat it with the help of your doctor.\nWhat Causes Diabetic Diarrhea?\nTo understand what causes diabetic diarrhea, we need to understand how diabetes works. Diabetes affects nearly one in every 20 Americans. It\u2019s a disease where your body either doesn\u2019t produce enough insulin or can\u2019t use its own insulin correctly. Without insulin, your body can\u2019t convert food into energy\u2014so you have really bad blood sugar control that leads to chronic high blood sugar and all sorts of nasty complications.\nAre Laxatives Safe For Diabetics?\nWhile there is no cure for diabetes, treatment can help control blood sugar levels. This can prevent some of the symptoms and complications of diabetes, such as blurred vision, infections, and impotence. Treatment may include medication (injections or pills), diet changes, and exercise. Laxatives are not prescribed for treating constipation in most people with diabetes because they make it harder to control blood sugar levels.\nCan I Treat Myself or My Child Without Medical Help?\nIf you have diabetes, it's essential to learn how to treat minor diarrhea. Ask your doctor if there are any prescription or over-the-counter medications that might help you. If these remedies don't work, be sure to ask your doctor about more serious treatments (such as steroids) that could stop diarrhea without causing side effects.\nWhen Should I Call a Doctor or Health Care Provider About Diabetic Bowel Illness?\nFor some people, symptoms of diabetic bowel illness will go away on their own. If your diarrhea lasts longer than a few days, or if you have other problems such as stomach pain, call your doctor or health care provider. You may need to change your treatment plan. If symptoms are severe or continue for more than two weeks, get emergency medical help right away.\nWhat Are the Long-Term Effects of Diabetes on the Bowel?\nOne of these long-term effects is to cause microscopic tears in the walls of your small intestine, which leads to inflammation. This, in turn, may lead to other problems, such as leaky gut syndrome and bacterial overgrowth. Inflammation and bacterial overgrowth also may increase your chances of having diarrhea. In some cases, inflammatory bowel disease may develop. Long-term diabetes can damage any part of your digestive tract.\nHow Do I Know If I Have Diabetes and Diabetes-Related Problems?\nIf you\u2019re reading this, it\u2019s likely you already know whether or not you have diabetes. However, if you\u2019re still not sure and are hoping to figure out if there is anything wrong with your health, then simply ask yourself these three questions: Am I tired all of the time? Do I have to go to the bathroom all of the time? Do I drink more than 2 quarts of water per day? If you answered yes to two of those questions, then there is a very good chance that you are experiencing one (or both) signs of diabetes\u2014diabetes-related problems are commonly referred to as the silent disease. It will be important for you to learn about diabetes; almost every American has either been diagnosed with type 2 or 3. Diabetes can cause many different complications (including erectile dysfunction), which can ultimately lead to death if left untreated; it would be wise for those suffering from any form of diabetic complication (like erectile dysfunction) to find professional medical help immediately!\nWho Is at Risk for Having These Problems Related to Diabetes and Poor Blood Sugar Control?\nPeople with diabetes can suffer from diarrhea and/or constipation, especially those who have just been diagnosed. Their blood sugar levels are likely not well-controlled, so they may not be eating enough fiber to help them stay regular. They\u2019re also at risk for vitamin and mineral deficiencies that can cause problems (such as iron deficiency anemia). The following groups of people with diabetes are particularly vulnerable to diarrhea and/or constipation children and teenagers; pregnant women; elderly patients. Newer medications known as thiazolidinediones (pioglitazone or rosiglitazone) are commonly prescribed to help diabetics lose weight because these drugs increase insulin sensitivity and make it easier for your body to absorb nutrients.\nHowever, recent reports indicate that some users experience severe diarrhea while taking these drugs in conjunction with medications called proton pump inhibitors, which inhibit stomach acid production in order to reduce gastrointestinal side effects from other types of medication (anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen). These side effects usually occur when taking a high dose of pioglitazone or rosiglitazone combined with any kind of gastrointestinal medication such as Nexium or Prilosec.",

        "a_text": "Your query is a complex one\u2026 because to understand the cause of the rise in T1 (Type 1 diabetes mellitus), you must first understand what causes T1 - and to date, researchers have not quite figured that out; but we have a pretty good idea on the basics. So let\u2019s start there.\nT1 is an autoimmune disease, and is based in genetics. The exact genetics behind it are not fully understood - but there are several known genetic markers in the HLA complex that leave a person subject to the disease - but we also know that an environmental \u201ctrigger\u201d is needed for the disease to manifest. Many folks carry the genetic anomalies for T1 - but never get it; this is why less than 20% of T1s have a T1 relative.\nThe known genetic markers are primarily located in the Human Leukocyte Antigen complex - or HLA complex. This section of the human genome is where our immune systems are formulated - and T1 is a failure of the immune system. There are some other markers in other locations that are known, but their role(s) is/are not understood fully - but they obviously have an impact on the development of the immune system.\nThe biochemical cause of T1 is an autoimmune attack on the tiny portion of the pancreas (about 2% of it in total) that makes insulin - the pancreatic endocrine beta cells, which make two hormones - insulin and amylin. We can live without amylin - but not without insulin. Until the isolation and purification of insulin from animal pancreases in 1921 by Banting, Best, Colip and MacLeod at the University of Toronto Children\u2019s hospital, ALL T1s died within months of diagnosis. Since the vast majority of these patients were pre-pubescent children\u2026 none of them reproduced. So there\u2019s ONE possible connection to the rise in the disease - for the past 90 years, T1s have been reproducing - meaning there\u2019s more anomalous gene carriers than there were in the days when virtually all of them died before they were old enough to generate offspring. BUT\u2026 that\u2019s not the likely answer. More on why in a moment.\nBack to the biochemistry - the genetics cause a malfunction in the immune system, wherein the T-reg cells (the regulatory T cells, which are responsible for keeping the immune system from attacking it\u2019s own body\u2019s cells) fail to recognise \u201cself\u201d, and allow the killer T-cells to attack the insulin-producing beta cells. This brings us to the question of\u2026 why?\nThe short answer - so far; we don\u2019t know this completely - is that some sort of \u201ctrigger\u201d causes this to happen. We KNOW that certain viruses will trigger this malfunction - the enterovirus family is the most common trigger, plus mumps, rubella, rotavirus, and cytomegalovirus all of which are associated with the onset of T1. BUT\u2026 the subject must experience one of these viruses at a susceptible time. While many of these diseases have been severely limited nowadays, many are still quite common and even very mild (especially the enteroviruses), and patients may not even experience being \u201csick\u201d with them - they\u2019re short lived and very mild in their impact.\nBased on this known requirement for an environmental trigger, several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the environmental side of the equation being the underlying cause of the increase. To start - the genetic side is unlikely; while there are now T1s that reproduce, thereby passing on the genetic markers - it hasn\u2019t been long enough to explain the rapid rise in T1 incidence, and besides - the vast majority of carriers never did actually develop the disease - so the genetic markers are not likely much more prevalent than they were before T1s were surviving to reproductive age.\nIn the environmental cause camp - there are several competing arguments for why the environment is causing the increase in the rate of T1.\nFirst, and most likely (so far) is the Hygiene Hypothesis (Strachan, 1989). Strachan showed that exposure to a variety of infectious agents is protective. Epidemiological studies (Gale, 2002; DIAMOND Project Group, 2006, Soltesz et al 2007) have shown that the rise in T1 incidence has been matched by a drop in infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, mumps, measles, hepatitis A, and enteroviruses. The mechanism of this process is quite complex, and way beyond this response\u2026 but if you\u2019re interested in a more detailed analysis, read \u201cIn vivo Apoptosis of Diabetogenic T cells in NOD Mice\u201d, in International Immunology, 2004, by Qin Hy, et al.\nNext is the Viral Hypothesis. This theory proposes that the increase is somehow linked to the known viruses that \u201ctrigger\u201d the disease - but since the introduction of vaccines to limit the incidence of these diseases has reduced the exposure to most of them, it doesn\u2019t have a correlation to the rise in the incidence of T1. While the hypothesis is logical to the extent it is based on the known triggers, it just doesn\u2019t fit as an explanation for the rise in T1.\nNext is the Vitamin D Hypothesis. Vitamin D is known to play a role in the immune system function, via the VDR (Vitamin D Receptors) and enzymes involved in the immune system function. Finnish research has suggested an increase in the incidence of T1 following the reduction of Vitamin D supplementation (Hypponen et al, 2001). This one gets even more complicated - but it\u2019s one of the hypotheses out there to explain the rise in T1.\nThere are several other hypotheses for the rise in T1\u2026 but one thing that is likely, is that it is NOT one single cause, but likely, a multi-factorial based occurrence. It simply seems unlikely that a single factor would drive it - especially with so many different factors involved in the aetiology of the disease in the first place.",

It's simple, but definitely not easy to meditate for that long in a place where silence is enforced (along with some other rules that you should follow to maintain \u201cpurity\u201d). It's free and there is no catch. It's not as prominent in the west but it is huge elsewhere. You can find a few centres in the states and in Canada.\nI would highly highly highly recommend it. There is something magical about meditation and some key things happened there when I went:\nI was taking way less basal insulin and rapid meal time insulin. Sure, I wasn't ingesting as much carb, but meditating there definitely had some serious mental impacts as time went on. I felt resilient to stress, I felt way calmer, the things that used to annoy me didn't anymore, and much more (performing better in my job, no more depression, no more anxiety, improved relationships at home and work). It's amazing how feeling less stressed improves our sugars overall (less cortisol in the blood, etc)\nThere is an absolutely great deal of evidence that meditation has physical benefits along with the mental benefits. Many illnesses have a significant psychosomatic elements and some part of me deep inside believes that there may lie a solution for such a terrible illness.\nHowever, venturing down that path is a highly individual journey and results vary depending on how seriously you take it on. Diabetics are prone to a lot of other disorders and diseases due to the unrelenting nature of our disease, and meditation is a great way to remain centered both mentally and physically. It is great for everyone and there are no side effects.\nSome stuff to read :\nMeditation and the Art of Diabetes Management - Diabetes Self-Management",

        "a_text": "Q: \u201cWhat veggies are good for someone with type 1.5 diabetes?\u201d\nLet\u2019s start with \u201ctype 1.5 diabetes\u201d\u2026 THERE IS NO SUCH THING. It is a MIS-reference to LADA DM - Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adult Diabetes Mellitus - or, simply, Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. \u201cType 1.5\u201d was a MISNOMER that came into use years ago as researchers were trying to categorise a type of DM that didn\u2019t \u201cfit\u201d comfortably into the \u201ctraditional\u201d versions called \u201cType 1\u201d (T1) and \u201cType 2\u201d (T2) DM. BUT\u2026 it is simply a late-developing (compared to Type 1) autoimmune disease - just like Type 1, and NOT Type 2 - though it\u2019s later-onset (typically early 20\u2019s as oppposed to childhood) causes it to be mis-diagnosed as T2\u2026 because unlike traditional T1, it does not IMMEDIATELY require insulin - though insulin is the BEST treatment method immediately from the start, in order to preserve beta cell function (pancreatic endocrine beta cells are the cells that produce insulin).\nUnfortunately, the T1.5 terminology persists - even among docs, who are still not diagnosing patients until their BG (Blood Glucose) levels are WAY higher than normal (for example, a non-diabetic NEVER has a BG level above 150 mg/dl\u2026 but the diagnostic criteria maintain 200 mg/dl as necessary for a non-fasting BG in order to declare a patient \u201cdiabetic\u201d - this is why some 70% of newly-diagnosed diabetics ALREADY HAVE some \u201ccomplications\u201d at time of diagnosis.\nLADA T1 is usually treated the same as T2 by docs - because, in large part, there are so far no long-term studies of treatment methodologies for LADA T1. Unfortunately, this leads to complete loss of insulin-production before insulin treatment is started - and that\u2019s a bad thing; LADA T1 should be treated the same way as T1s in the \u201choneymoon\u201d period are treated - in order to maintain beta cell function.\nAs for dietary considerations - the point is NOT \u201cwhat\u201d you can eat\u2026 it\u2019s HOW MUCH you can eat - of CARBS. CARBS, NOT \u201csugar\u201d, are the issue in ALL types of DM. Because your body converts all carbs into glucose (the sugar our bodies run on) very fast. A slice of bread, or a teaspoon of table sugar - it\u2019s all the same to your gluc-regulatory system. The bread will take an extra ten minutes to become sugar\u2026 but it does, and it\u2019s fast enough to have little difference in impact. I\u2019m not suggesting you replace proper foods with sugar - because foods contain various minerals and vitamins and fibre you won\u2019t get from table sugar; but your BG levels are affected the same.\nThe POINT is to learn how many carbs to eat with each meal - and dose for them properly. \u201cVeggies\u201d is a generic term\u2026 and very inexact. AND\u2026 what a botanist calls a \u201cveggie\u201d is NOT what your gut calls a veggie. For example - corn is NOT a vegetable; it\u2019s a carbohydrate. Yes, botanically, it\u2019s a veggie\u2026 but that matters not a whit vis-a-vis your dietary management. Corn, potatoes, and so on are all loaded with carbs - so learning to count carbs, and limit EACH meal to the carbs your system can handle / your insulin dose is designed for, is the key to controlling BG levels.\nHere\u2019s some reading.\n1 - LADA and its treatment: Recognizing and Appropriately Treating Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults\n2 - Carb counting for beginners: https://www.bd.com/resource.aspx?IDX=9850\n3 - Carbs by foods: http://www.med.umich.edu/1libr/MEND/CarbList.pdf\n4 - Use your BG meter to manage diet: Test, Review, Adjust\n5 - Diabetes education: Diabetes Education Online\nNotes:\n1 is a good intro to the diagnosis and treatment of LADA\n2 is a good outline of how to count carbs and use the information.\n3 is a simple listing of carbs by foods for guidance; when available, use the nutrtion label.\n4 is a system geared to T2s that are NOT using insulin; you have to factor in your insulin use IF you are already using insulin - and that simply means you\u2019ll have to learn how to use a CFR and ICR to calculate doses\u2026 see 5\u2026\n5 is an excellent resource for learning about management of diabetes mellitus of all types; as a LADA, the Type 1 section is the one you want to refer to, and the one I\u2019ve linked you to; from there, there is a wealth of guidance and information.\nGood luck!",

You cannot survive very long without insulin, so after it was diagnosed, generally the individual died within a few weeks or months if lucky.\nBTW, insulin was not \u201cinvented.\u201d Insulin is a natural hormone produced by islet cells in the pancreas. In Type 1 diabetes, those cells are destroyed by the immune system, hence it is an autoimmune disease.\nIn the 1920s, scientists were able to isolate insulin from the pancreas of pigs. Because insulin evolution has been very conservative porcine and bovine insulin were close enough to human insulin to allow doctors to regulate the blood sugar of type 1 diabetics. By the 1980s, we were able to genetically engineer real human insulin, which is what is used today.\nNevertheless, before the 1920s, if you were diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, you died. No one survived it.",

        "a_text": "Q: \u201cWhat specific types of diabetes exist other than type 1, type 2, and gestational?\u201d\nThere are SEVEN TOTALLY DIFFERENT DISEASES CALLED \u201cDIABETES\u201d - each with subtypes.\nTo start - there are two major groupings: Diabetes Mellitus - DM - (the ones you are talking about), and Diabetes Insipidus - DI. There are THREE types of DM, each with subtypes, and four types of DI, most with subtypes.\nFirst, the terminology.\n\u201cDiabetes\u201d is the term coined by Appollonius of Memphis (Greece) about 250 BCE; it literally means \u201csiphon\u201d, or \u201cto pass through\u201d, and is a reference to the constant urination in ALL the patients of these diseases - which Appollonius thought was a single disease.\nThe \u201csecond\u201d names of these diseases were added by an English physician in the 1600s, to distinguish them from one another.\n\u201cMellitus\u201d is latin for \u201choney-sweet\u201d, and is a reference to the glucose (sugar) in the urine of patients of those three diseases. All of which involve a lack of, or poor response to (or both) the hormone insulin, which results in a loss of gluco-regulatory control, leading to elevated BG (Blood Glucose - aka, sugar) levels.\n\u201cInsipidus\u201d refers to the urine of patients of these four disease, which is colourless, odourless, and tasteless; or Insipid. These diseases all involve a lack of, poor storage of, or poor response to the hormone vasopressin. Vasopressin, aka \u201canti-diuretic hormone\u201d controls fluid balance, inhibiting the kidneys from producing urine when fluid levels are proper or low; when our bodies need to clear out fluids, the hormone is withheld, and we urinate. In these patients, the hormone is either lacking or ineffective, and they must urinate constantly and excessively.\nIn DM patients, the excess urination is caused by BG (Blood Glucose) levels being too high; once they reach the renal threshold (about 180 mg/dl, or 10 mmol/L), the kidneys try to \u201cflush out\u201d the excess through the urinary tract, and that induces excessive urination - and resulting extreme thirst.\nBack to the types of DM. There are three.\nType 1 is autoimmune DM, wherein a genetic anomaly leaves us susceptible to an immune system malfunction wherein the body\u2019s own immune system attacks and destroys a tiny portion of the pancreas - the pancreatic endocrine beta cells (less than 2% of a healthy pancreas). These cells produce two hormones - insulin and amylin. Both of these serve to reduce BG levels when they rise; we can live without amylin - but NOT without insulin. This is why ALL T1s (Type 1 diabetics) must inject insulin to live. Insulin is essentially a transporter; it facilitates the transfer of glucose from the bloodstream (which is constantly carrying it around to cells that need it - and ALL cells need it in varying amounts and times) into the cells. If this transfer doesn\u2019t happen - BG levels get too high, and the cells don\u2019t get the fuel they need; without insulin, we die. Until the discovery, isolation and purification of insulin in 1921, ALL T1s died shortly after diagnosis.\nBesides \u201ctraditional\u201d T1, there is LADA T1. This is the same disease, but it develops more slowly, and after age 35. Traditional T1 can occur at any age - but about 80% of cases develop in childhood; the median age at diagnosis is 14. But LADA T1 develops after age 35, and more slowly.\nThere\u2019s also a monogenic form of DM called Neonatal DM; this is technically not the same as T1, and many researchers consider it it\u2019s own disease. But it\u2019s usually \u201clumped in\u201d with T1 because it ALWAYS happens in children - and often in unborn children. And always before 6 months of age. There are two sub-sub types of this one - \u201ctransient\u201d and permanent. There are SEVERAL genetic markers that cause this, but all are single-gene anomalies; T1 involves multiple genetic anomalies. Like T1, NDM involves a lack of insulin - but NOT due to an autoimmune attack.\nType 2 DM (T2) is a disease wherein the body\u2019s cells do not respond properly to insulin. This is called \u201cinsulin resistance\u201d. These patients actually make MORE than normal amounts of insulin - but over time, the disease causes the cellular resistance to insulin to increase, and eventually - they can no longer make enough \u201cextra\u201d insulin to overcome that resistance, and BG levels rise too high. Gestational DM IS T2 - it\u2019s a sub-type of it. During pregnancy, the placenta secretes hormones that cause increased cellular resistance to insulin, and others that clear insulin out; this results in elevated BG levels. The vast majority of women that experience GDM will ultimately develop T2 years later. SO\u2026 GDM is nothing more than \u201cearly onset\u201d T2 due to the hormonal stresses of pregnancy. The genetics behind GDM are identical to T2. There are over 80 genetic markers associated with T2, but so far, only three that are absolutely confirmed as causative. Without the genetic markers, you don\u2019t get the disease; but having them does NOT mean you must get the disease.\nThere are another 11 sub-types of T2 called MODY - Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young. M.O.D. is a left-over term from before we understood that the diseases are NOT related to age; but that naming convention still exists. Like NDM, these 11 disease are monogenic - and considered by many to be completely different diseases. But they involve cellular resistance to insulin (and a limited loss of insulin production), and have been associated with T2 for a long time. They are extremely rare, and most are very \u201cmild\u201d and rarely ever require insulin.\nFinally, there\u2019s Type 3c, or T3c. This is pancreatogenic DM, wherein an unrelated disease of the exocrine pancreas (such as pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, haemochromatosis, or cystic fibrosis) damages the endocrine pancreas - including those endocrine beta cells, leaving the patient with severely reduced insulin production. Each of the diseases that cause this is a sub-type; so, for a pancreatic cancer patient, it\u2019s Type 3c Pancreatic Cancer. And so on. These are all known as \u201csecondary\u201d DM, because they are secondary to the underlying disease.\nSO\u2026 that\u2019s an outline of the many diseases called \u201cdiabetes\u201d. They are all different, have different causes, and significant differences in treatments.",

When it became possible to measure insulin, it became clear that the ones who died had no insulin and everybody was surprised that the ones who didn\u2019t die actually often had more insulin than people without diabetes. When diabetics were found to have high fasting glucose in the morning, Somogyi reckoned that this was because they\u2019d hypoe\u2019d in the night. When it became possible to continuously monitor blood sugar in the night, this was found not to be true, and the dawn phenomenon came to be blamed instead. When it was figured out that glucagon and insulin action had a reciprocal relationship, and that glucagon raised blood sugar, nobody realized the corollary that a lowcarb diet lowered liver glycogen levels which lowered diabetic\u2019s fasting blood sugar because that blood sugar is driven by glycogenolysis, the breaking down of glycogen into glucose driven by glucagon. The low-carb diet is, then, the remedy for diabetes and allows them to have normal blood sugars. So the answer to your question is: right of course science is trying to mislead the public it\u2019s a conspiracy, er, not.

After all, they both result in excessive bleeding.\nYes, T1 (Type 1 DM - Diabetes Mellitus) and T2 (Type 2 DM) are treated differently - because they are two TOTALLY DIFFERENT diseases; Type 3c, or T3c, is yet ANOTHER COMPLETELY DIFFERENT disease. Let\u2019s review.\nALL three types of DM involve a malfunction in the gluco-regulatory system that maintains BG (Blood Glucose) in a tight range of about 90 to 120 mg/dl (5.00 to 6.67 mmol/L for non-U.S. readers).\nT2 is the most common type of DM, representing over 90% of all DM patients. It is GENETIC in nature - caused by genetic anomalies that cause the victim\u2019s body\u2019s cells to resist the action of insulin. You don\u2019t get this disease without the genetic markers, but over-consumption of carbohydrates, excess weight, and a sedentary lifestyle will accelerate its onset. Of course, those are also SYMPTOMS - because the genetics that make you susceptible to the disease, also make you susceptible to those conditions as well. The PRIMARY treatments for T2 are \u201cdiet\u201d and \u201cexercise\u201d. These are ABSOLUTELY necessary - there is NO \u201cmedication\u201d that will work effectively without also employing these tactics.\nBy \u201cdiet\u201d, we mean carb limitation. T2 is a disease of cellular resistance to the action of insulin. which means it takes a LOT more insulin to \u201cclear\u201d glucose from the bloodstream. Carbs are the PRIMARY source of glucose in our diets - so limiting carbs, and replacing them with proteins and healthy fats, lowers the amount of glucose your system has to deal with in the first place.\n\u201cExercise\u201d refers to ANY PA - Physical Activity. PA increases your cellular response to insulin - put another way, regular PA increases your body\u2019s cellular response to insulin. AND\u2026 that response remains long after the PA ends; if you get REGULAR daily (or at least 5 days out of 7) PA, you will MAINTAIN improved cellular sensitivity to insulin. Most folks know that PA will \u201cburn off\u201d BG - Blood Glucose - but the REAL BENEFIT of regular exercise is CONSTANT improved cellular response to insulin.\nThere are MANY T2 medications that are used to augment these tactics to bring BG into range\u2026 but NONE is effective without ALSO employing \u201cdiet\u201d and \u201cexercise\u201d. Some of these meds stimulate greater production of insulin (these are called \u201cinsulin scretagogues\u201d), some slow the absorption of carbs in the digestive tract, some suppress the body\u2019s natural BG-raising function (metformin), and some \u201cflush out\u201d glucose from the urine into the urinary tract. ALL of these medications have \u201cside effects\u201d - and NONE of them do ANYTHING to help T1 diabetics.\nT1 is the next most common type of DM, at less than 10% of all cases. This is autoimmune DM, wherein the patient\u2019s own immune system attacks and destroys the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas - the endocrine beta cells. These are LESS than 2% of a healthy pancreas. And they\u2019re the ONLY natural source of insulin in mammals. The ONLY treatment for this disease is injection of exogenous insulin - for the rest of your life. Based on calculate basal doses, Correction doses, and Carb coverage doses. Without insulin - we die. Period.\nFinally, there\u2019s T3c - which is less than 1% of all DM cases. This version of DM is imposed when an unrelated disease of the exocrine pancreas damages the endocrine pancreas - and the cells that produce insulin. It results in a condition similar to T1, in which the victim must use exogenous insulin to replace lost insulin production - but less than the typical T1 needs, because typically, not all insulin production is lost; but then, each case is different, and must be assessed individually.",

Hb stands for haemoglobin, and A1c is s sub-type of haemoglobin that has partially bound to glucose molecules, and is termed \u201cglycated\u201d - because the chemical process through which that happens is called glycosylation, and in this case (non-enzymatic glycosylation), glycation. Hence the full term - glycated haemoglobin.\nDocs over-simplify the answer, saying it\u2019s an \u201caverage\u201d of your BG (Blood Glucose) over the past three months - but it\u2019s NOT. Here\u2019s a longer explanation of the HbA1c test and it\u2019s meaning; be patient - there\u2019s a lot here, but it\u2019s important to understand.\nThe HbA1c test has NOTHING TO DO WITH BLOOD GLUCOSE measurements - averages or otherwise. What the HbA1c test measures is the percentage of your haemoglobin that has \"glycated\", or bound chemically with glucose molecules (sugar). The more glucose there is in your bloodstream over time, the more of your haemoglobin will have bound to sugar. This last point is the underlying cause of the utter misconception that the HbA1c is some kind of \"average\" of BG levels, which it is NOT - no matter how many times that falsehood is repeated. HbA1c is a sub-type of haemoglobin that is undesirable in high levels because it causes the damage to organs and blood vessels that result in the \"complications\" of D - blindness, kidney failure, heart disease, and so on. Besides the 1c subtype of HbA, there are 1a and 1b subtypes - just for clarification.\n\nNon-D's HbA1c levels range from about 3.5% to 5.5% of overall HbA. For every point above that top end, you increase your risk of those complications by about 30% (a). THAT is the point of the HbA1c measure. BUT... keep in mind, even non-D's suffer (much lower rates of) heart disease, kidney disease, blindness, and so on. So while keeping your HbA1c as close to \"normal\" as possible significantly reduces your risk of these diseases, it is not a guarantee that you'll not get one/some of them.\n\nBack to the \"average\" BG concept... as noted above, the more sugar in your bloodstream, the more glycation, and the higher the resulting HbA1c level. BUT... there are many other factors that affect your HbA1c level as well. The formula used to \"convert\" HbA1c to EAG (ESTIMATED Average Glucose) is based on AVERAGES of MANY different individuals - no two of which have the same biochemistry, nor do any of theirs exactly \"match\" yours. Trying to compute either one from the other (EAG from HbA1c, or HbA1c from BG) is a fool's errand.\n\nThe POINT of the EAG reference was to give patients an idea of what their HbA1c measure meant, in terms they were used to dealing with - BG levels. BUT... again, it's based on averages which are derived from large population studies which ASSUMES certain underlying biochemical constants that simply aren't true for each and every individual. The point of the EAG reference is to put the individual patient's control (or lack thereof) into perspective.\n\nThe important comparison for an individual patient is to his/her past HbA1c levels - NOT to a mathematically derived \"average\". Over time, the individual patient with improving control will see a lowering in the HbA1c levels... while a patient experiencing control issues will see an increase. AND... the HbA1c # itself is reliable for predicting those complications.\n\nFactors affecting your HbA1c level (besides blood glucose levels) include your erythrocyte (red blood cell) lifespan (everyone's varies), haemoglobin variants (there are many different kinds and they react differently to the glycation process), use of Vitamin C or Vitamin E can cause a \"false low\" HbA1c result, as can low doses of Aspirin - while high doses of Aspirin can result in a false high (b). All of this - and more - should be considered when interpreting the results of the HbA1c test.\n\nThe \"conversion\" of BG #'s to HbA1c #'s, and vice versa, are a mathematical formula applied to the known # to INFER a value for the unknown #. Again, this formula ASSUMES you have the exact same biochemistry as the \"average\" of all of the patients tested in establishing the formula:\n(28.7 x A1c) - 46.7 = EAG\n\nSo, for an A1c of 5.5%:\n(28.7 x 5.5) - 46.7 = EAG\n(157.85) - 46.7 = EAG\n111 = EAG\n\nOr, for a BG reading of 90:\n(28.7 x A1c) - 46.7 = 90\n(28.7 x A1c) = 90+46.7\n(28.7 x A1c) = 136.7\nA1c = 136.7/28.7\nA1c = 4.76\n\nBUT... remember that all this math is just that - what's important is measuring the actual HbA1c, and the actual BG levels - the fact that they're related is important, but trying to \"prove\" the math is foolishness - because NO individual's biochemistry is precisely the same as the average of the several large groups used to develop the formula, and furthermore - not even the same today as it was yesterday. And in order to get a valid BG \"average\" to compare to your HbA1c test - you'd have to test your BG at least 10 times a day EVERY DAY for the entire 100 days preceding the HbA1c test. And even 10 tests a day might be too few.\nNowadays, with CGMs (Continuous Glucose Monitors), the preferred method of measuring success is TIR - Time In Range. In short, this is simply a measure of the percentage of time a patient spends within their target range. Here\u2019s a useful article on TIR: New Recommendations for Time-in-Range Targets During Continuous Glucose Monitoring Presented Today at the ADA\u2019s Scientific Sessions\n\n\nw.\n\n(a) - NIH ADVANCE Collaborative Group\n(b) - NIH - PMC 3401751",

To start\u2026 your query demonstrates a lack of understanding of what you are asking\u2026 so let\u2019s start with some basics.\n\u201cBlood sugar\u201d refers to the sugar in the bloodstream of animals, which is the monosaccharide (\u201csingle sugar\u201d) glucose. We can get glucose from ALL the foods we eat\u2026 depending on various circumstances, we primarily get it from carbohydrates, but if we eat no carbs - our digestive tracts will generate it from the proteins and fats we eat (which are the only two other macronutrients in our diets).\nGlucose is the fuel our bodies run on - literally; without it, we die (very fast). Too much, and we die (very slowly). It\u2019s in our bloodstream for one reason - to be delivered to each and every cell of our bodies, which need it to live. The ONLY other fuel our bodies can use directly in lieu of glucose is ketones\u2026 which are derived from adipose (fat) and muscle tissue; this is what people that are starving, and folks utilising the \u201cketo diet\u201d are running on. Each cell of your body uses that fuel to perform a function called cellular respiration - which has nothing to do with your breathing; it refers to the process by which cells generate the energy they need to live.\nIn any event, in ALL living animals, BG levels rise and fall all the time, constantly, and sometimes changing very fast. Sometimes it\u2019s \u201chigh\u201d, sometimes it\u2019s \u201clow\u201d - but it\u2019s ALWAYS changing. AND\u2026 it\u2019s always different throughout your body. After a meal, the highest concentration of glucose is in the vasculature of your small intestines; at the end of a long fast, the highest concentration of glucose will be in the vasculature of the liver - which supplies us with the glucose we need when there is no food present. The liver stores glucose (in a form called glycogen) for this purpose.\nIn adult humans, BG (Blood Glucose) ranges from about 90 to 120 mg/dl\u2026 or 5.00 to 6.67 mmol/L (outside the U.S., mmol/L is the standard measure of BG concentration). In children, the range is broader, ranging both higher and lower - but mostly higher, primarily due to growth and hormonal development.\n\u201cDiabetes\u201d literally means \u201csiphon\u201d in ancient Greek\u2026 and refers to the primary symptoms of the SEVEN totally DIFFERENT diseases \u201clumped\u201d under this term. Those symptoms are polyurea (excessive urination) and polydipsia (extreme unquenchable thirst\u201d.\nThere are TWO major categories of \u201cdiabetes\u201d: DI (Diabetes Insipidus), and DM (Diabetes Mellitus).\nDI is a group of four relatively rare diseases involving a lack of, poor storage of, or poor response to the hormone AVP - Arginine Vasopressin. AVP is the fluid-balance hormone; it maintains your body\u2019s fluid levels by regulating the excretion of urine from the kidneys. When AVP is lacking or ineffective, you can\u2019t stop urinating; that dehydrates you. All of that results in the symptoms of polyurea and polydipsia. BG is NOT affected at all by these four diseases.\nDM is a group of three diseases, each with multiple sub-types, which affect BG levels. All of these diseases involve a lack of, or poor response to, the hormone insulin. There are three \u201ctypes\u201d.\nIn all three types, the symptoms of polyurea and polydipsia are caused by BG rising too high - 180 mg/dl (10 mmol/L) or more. When BG is that high (or higher), the kidneys can no longer recover the glucose from the blood as they screen it; so instead of recovering it and storing it, they \u201cspill\u201d the glucose into the urinary tract/bladder. That requires fluid - to create urine; that dehydrates you, making you more thirsty; and forces you to urinate more.\nType 1 DM is Autoimmune DM; this disease is caused by a genetic pre-disposition wherein the immune system malfunctions. In response to an environmental \u201ctrigger\u201d (one of several viruses - but there are many more \u201csuspects\u201d not yet confirmed), the immune system \u201cgoes rogue\u201d and attacks and destroys a TINY portion of the pancreas - the pancreatic endocrine beta cells; these constitute less than 2% of a healthy pancreas. SO\u2026 in us T1s (Type 1 DM patients), about 98% of our pancreas is fine and fully functional. BUT\u2026 we produce NO insulin or amylin (a \u201chelper hormone\u201d to insulin, also produced in those beta cells).\nWithout insulin - we die. In a matter of a few weeks. Insulin is the primary hormone for transferring glucose OUT of the bloodstream, and into the cells of the body. Not all cells need insulin to achieve that transfer... but most do. So without insulin, most of the body\u2019s cells starve to death. Even though BG levels rise much too high - because the glucose can\u2019t \u201cget out\u201d of the bloodstream.\nInsulin performs MANY other functions - but that\u2019s the primary one causing problems in untreated T1 - type 1 DM.\nSO\u2026 the standard treatment - and the ONLY treatment that works at this time - is to inject exogenous insulin to replace the natural insulin that is no longer there. We don\u2019t have to inject amylin, because we can live without amylin; but we must inject insulin to stay alive.\nBUT\u2026 miscalculate the dose by just a bit - and you can lower your BG levels too much, causing \u201ca hypo\u201d - a hypoglycaemic event, or \u201clow\u201d. Hypoglycaemia is \u201cofficially\u201d from 70 mg/dl (3.9 mmol/L) and lower. But many folks will feel symptoms at slightly higher levels (feel faint, shaky, weak, irritable, et al).\nInsulin is administered for two purposes.\nFirst is basal needs. Insulin is needed to provide the fuel for heartbeat, breathing, brain function, digestion, and all the other autonomic functions your body does without you really thinking about it. This is achieved in us T1s with a fixed daily dose used every day - or infused by a pump at a constant rate all day long.\nSecond is bolus needs\u2026 which include two components of their own: mealtime glucose surges (when we eat, our digestive systems convert the food into glucose within about 1 to 2 hours), and \u201ccorrections\u201d when BG rises too high. So before each and every meal\u2026 a T1 must calculate a dose of insulin to \u201ccover\u201d the glucose from the meal, and to \u201ccorrect\u201d BG IF it is too high. Those on MDI (Multiple Daily Injections) simply inject the insulin; a pump user simply schedules a \u201csurge\u201d of insulin infusion in addition to the ongoing basal \u201cdrip\u201d.\nSO\u2026 while the underlying problem in Type 1 DM is high BG levels\u2026 we experience both highs and lows once we\u2019re being treated for it. Just like Normals (non-diabetics) do. BUT\u2026 our highs and lows are much higher and lower than Normals experience - if we\u2019re not careful! ;-)",

Do her children run the risk of becoming a diabetic as well?\u201d\nTo start\u2026 there are three basic types of DM (Diabetes Mellitus); one has NOTHING to do with genetics; one is genetic; and one is hereditary.\nThe most common type, T2 (Type 2 DM), accounts for OVER 90% of all DM patients, and is hereditary; that means that it is not only carried in the genetic code (primarily on chromosome 2 of the human genome - but also in some other places), but it also tends to manifest in successive generations. These folks are most likely to pass the genetic cause on to their children. This version of the disease is due to cellular resistance to insulin - and therefore requires dietary restrictions and regular exercise.\nThe second most common type, T1, autoimmune DM wherein insulin production is completely lost, accounts for less than 10% of all DM patients, and though it is genetic - it is NOT hereditary\u2026 but the genes that cause it are more likely than not to be passed on. BUT\u2026 it takes MORE than just the genetics to develop the disease. This disease requires insulin injections - and dietary controls geared to the amount of insulin used.\nThe third type, T3c, or pancreatogenic DM, has NOTHING to do with genetics (and accounts for less than 1% of all DM cases); it is a sort of collateral-damage version of the disease, wherein an unrelated disease of the exocrine pancreas (pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, cystic fibrosis) damages the endocrine pancreas, and impairs insulin production, requiring dietary controls and insulin injections.\nBack on T1\u2026 if your daughter was 25 or older when she gave birth, the child has a 1% chance of developing T1; if she was under 25 when she gave birth, the child has about a 4% chance. In the general population, the \u201codds\u201d of developing T1 are about 0.02% (that\u2019s me - aren\u2019t I lucky? - the only \u201clottery\u201d I\u2019ve ever won).\nKEEP IN MIND\u2026 these are just statistical \u201clikelihoods\u201d; there\u2019s no certainty in them. you (and your daughter, son in law, and grandkids) could go nuts if you focus on this too much. Another statistical note\u2026 most children of T1s develop the disease (if they do) BY the age at which the parent developed it; so, when each of my kids turned 12, I celebrated\u2026 I was diagnosed at 11, so their \u201codds\u201d went down when they passed that milestone. The youngest of the three is now 25; and my granddaughter is 13 (I celebrated when she turned 12 as well).\nInterestingly, while about 80% of T2s have one or more T2 relatives\u2026 most (about 82%) T1s do NOT have a T1 relative\u2026 but there are some familial \u201cclusters\u201d of T1, meaning that it SEEMS to be able to \u201crun\u201d in clusters\u2026 but mostly doesn\u2019t; but that would also mean that for the average to be so low - the \u201cclusters\u201d must account for most of the T1s with T1 relatives\u2026 so if your and your husband\u2019s families do NOT have several T1s in them\u2026 the \u201codds\u201d are even lower\u2026 but now we\u2019re getting into speculation.

        "rating": "keep",
        "a_text": "Q: \u201cWhy do diabetics have to constantly measure their blood sugar?\u201d\nDM (Diabetes Mellitus) refers to THREE totally different diseases that cause BG (Blood Glucose) levels to get too high - and when BG levels are too high, you die an early, painful, ugly death. Elevated BG levels cause elevated AGES (Advanced Glycation End productS) levels; these AGES adhere to and smother ALL the body\u2019s tissues, and the glucose itself abraids the interior walls of the vasculature (blood vessels). The resulting damage causes hypertension, CAD, PAD, heart disease, strokes, blindness, and renal failure - and that\u2019s just a few of the more ugly \u201ccomplications\u201d of DM.\nBG is raised by ALL the foods we eat, but primarily, carbohydrates (fats and proteins also raise BG, but by much smaller amounts). BG is \u201cburned off\u201d by simply being alive - every cell of the body \u201cburns\u201d glucose as its fuel; but by exercising, we burn it off at a much greater rate - AND, most importantly (for Type 2 diabetics), exercise improves cellular response to insulin; Type 2 is CAUSED by cellular resistance to the action of insulin.\nInsulin is ONE of SIX hormones that control BG levels. In non-diabetics, BG ranges from about 90 to 120 mg/dl (5.00 to 6.67 mmol/L for non-U.S. readers). There will be some brief excursions up into the 140\u2019s mg/dl, or down into the 80\u2019s mg/dl. But that\u2019s a \u201ctight\u201d range, and staying within it is the key to forestalling the \u201ccomplications\u201d of DM. BUT\u2026 that\u2019s very hard to do.\nType 2 (Insulin Resistant) DM is the most common type (representing more than 90% of all DM patients). It is CAUSED by genetics, which cause the biochemical \u201cfault\u201d of cellular resistance to the action of insulin - which is the hormone that allows glucose to transfer out of the bloodstream (the body\u2019s \u201cdelivery system\u201d) and into the cells - which NEED it for fuel. When the cells resist that transfer - too much glucose gets \u201cleft behind\u201d in the bloodstream, and too little gets into the cells. This causes the brain to trigger the release of insulin\u2019s primary counter-regulatory hormone, glucagon - which RAISES BG even more. For these patients, checking BG regularly to learn how much different types and amounts of foods raise their BG is the KEY tactic to adjust their BG levels. There are NO oral T2 (Type 2 DM) medications that will achieve this without also employing \u201cdiet and exercise\u201d (carb limitation and REGULAR physical activity) to keep BG in range. Here\u2019s a useful pair of pages on this for T2s:\nFor the newly diagnosed: Getting Started\nUse your BG meter to manage BG: Test, Review, Adjust\nType 1 (Autoimmune) DM is the second most common type (representing less than 10% of all DM patients). It is CAUSED by an autoimmune attack on the pancreatic endocrine beta cells - the cells of the pancreas that make and release insulin. Without insulin, we die. Period. ALL T1s died prior to the discovery, isolation and purification of insulin in 1921. To know how much insulin to use, we must test our BG MANY times a day; I test mine about 8 to 10 times a day - upon waking, before each meal, one and two hours after each meal, and at bedtime; that\u2019s usually 10 times because \u201cupon waking\u201d and \u201cbefore breakfast\u201d are the same test; but I skip some of those tests on different days.\nInsulin is dosed in two components - \u201cbasal\u201d and \u201cbolus\u201d. Basal insulin is a long-acting (24-hour) dose that provides the insulin needed to maintain basal metabolic functions - breathing, heartbeat, digestion, brain function, sight, and so on. This is generally a \u201cfixed\u201d dose that\u2019s the same every day - though it can be adjusted from time to time to provide for \u201calterations\u201d - having a cold or flu, travelling and experiencing higher stress levels, and so on, can affect the basal need. That requires paying attention to one\u2019s response to changes in the environmental factors - and that requires regular testing.\nBolus insulin refers to the insulin needed to manage the glucose from food eaten. A rapid-acting insulin is used immediately before meals, based on the carbs to be eaten in the meal. An I:C ratio is used for this: an Insulin to Carb ratio. Mine is 1:8 - meaning I take 1 unit of insulin for every 8 grams of carbs I\u2019m about to eat. SO\u2026 if my meal contains 40 grams of carbs, I\u2019ll take 5 units of insulin (40/8 = 5). BUT WAIT\u2026 these mealtime doses ALSO include an adjustment dose. My pre-meal \u201ctarget\u201d BG level is NO MORE than 100 mg/dl. SO\u2026 if my BG before a meal is over 100, I add some insulin to the mealtime dose. Let\u2019s say it\u2019s 130 mg/dl before that meal. My CFR (Correction Factor Ratio) is 1:15 - meaning I take 1 unit of insulin for every 15 points above 100 mg/dl. At 130, that\u2019s 30 points too high - 30/15 = 2, so I add 2 units to the 5 I\u2019m taking for the meal itself, and my dose is a total of 7 units.\nAt two hours after a meal, my BG is supposed to be back to 100 mg/dl\u2026 if it\u2019s not, I may take additional insulin to correct it (using the CFR, but also factoring in my IOB - Insulin On Board, which refers to the fact that the mealtime dose of bolus insulin is still working. The point of an additional correction is to address the possibility that I ate a greater quantity of carbs, plus some other possible causes of a greater post-meal spike.\nIn short - ANYONE using insulin (many T2s ALSO use insulin) must test frequently to get their insulin doses \u201cright\u201d - and keep their BG in range.\nType 3c DM patients are rare - less than 1% of all DM patients. Like T1s, they\u2019ve also lost insulin production - but NOT due to an autoimmune failure. T3c, or pancreatogenic DM is caused by an unrelated disease of the exocrine pancreas that damages the endocrine pancreas, and impairs insulin production. These folks usually retain SOME amount of insulin production - but not enough. They too must use insulin, as T1s do.\nSO\u2026 testing BG levels frequently is the key to staying alive - AND avoiding/forestalling the complications of DM. And BTW - MOST diabetics do NOT die of diabetes itself; they die of the \u201ccomplications\u201d - stroke, heart disease, kidney failure, and many others. ONLY by keeping BG as close to non-diabetic range can we live without those \u201ccomplications\u201d. I\u2019ve been a T1 for over 53 years - and so far, have NO serious \u201ccomplications\u201d. I do suffer from mild hypertension - but it\u2019s controlled. Just like my BG levels.",

        "a_text": "Diabetes and the Psychiatric Patient\nDiabetes mellitus (DM) is more prevalent among patients with psychiatric illness compared with the general population. In addition to this, psychiatric patients are at greater risk for developing metabolic syndrome (MetS).1 MetS is characterized by abdominal or central obesity, atherogenic dyslipidemia (i.e., elevated triglycerides [TG] and reduced HDL cholesterol), insulin resistance (IR), and hypertension (HTN).2 For these reasons, together with the potential for metabolic adverse effects (AEs) associated with numerous psychotropic drugs--most notably atypical antipsychotics (AAs)--psychiatric patients must be closely monitored. Pharmacists have a unique role in the monitoring process because of their knowledge about medications and their visibility in the health care setting.\nAssociation of Psychiatric Illness With DM and CVD\nDepression, anxiety disorders, dementia, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder (BD) occur more commonly in DM patients. DM may be involved in the development of the first three conditions.3 The exact mechanism by which DM may be linked to these conditions is not fully understood.\nThere appears to be a bidirectional relationship between DM and depression.4 About 7% of DM cases are thought to be attributed to depression.5 Depression is associated with a 60% to 65% increased risk of DM.5,6 Depression, which is postulated to be a state of chronic stress, has been associated with elevated cortisol levels and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis abnormalities.7-10 Additionally, depression has been associated with IR.9,11 Both depression and high cortisol levels are associated with an increased risk of MetS.12 A possible correlation has been found between a 10-point difference in Beck Depression Inventory score and a 1% (approximate) change in hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C).13 Depression also is associated with increased severity of diabetic complications.14\nCentral serotonergic function has been linked to both depressive symptomatology and IR.9 Further, depressed patients are more likely to be unengaged in self-care, noncompliant with dietary and weight-loss recommendations, or physically inactive--all of which can worsen obesity and IR.10,15 This risk is compounded by medications used to treat depression, which may contribute to weight gain (WG) and obesity and may be associated with increased risk of DM.4,10,15 Anxiety has been associated with an increase in inflammatory markers in DM patients, and up to 80% of DM patients experience anxiety secondary to their underlying endocrine abnormality.\nNatural Remedies for Type 2 Diabetes - Click Here To Read",

For diabetics, a healthy diet is quintessential and any untoward spike in blood sugar is potentially fatal. Along with foods, there are some spices that may help regulate blood sugar levels. Here are some spices that cure type 2 diabetes.\n1. Turmeric (Haldi)\nAs per a study published in the journal Evidence-based Complementary and Alternative Medicine, the active compound in turmeric called curcumin may help decrease the level of glucose in blood, further reducing diabetes-related complications.\n2. Cloves (Laung)\nCloves have antiseptic as well as germicidal properties. Moreover, they offer anti-inflammatory, analgesic and digestive health benefits for diabetes. Cloves also help keep your blood sugar levels in check and are known to promote insulin production, further controlling diabetes.\n3. Garlic (Lehsun)\nAccording to a study published in the journal Phytomedicine, consumption of garlic increased the serum insulin in diabetic rats. So make sure you are adding enough garlic in your daily diet.\n4. Cinnamon (Dalchini)\nCinnamon is an antioxidant that's been shown to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce fasting blood sugars. In fact, according to a study published in the International Journal of Molecular Science, cinnamon has the ability to improve insulin sensitivity.

As it is Diabetes Awareness Month, we wanted to take the opportunity to look at the current state of diabetes and insulin access worldwide, and how this could change in the future.\nSome quick-fire figures\nIt is hard to accurately estimate the worldwide prevalence of diabetes, as many cases are undiagnosed. For this reason, estimates from different sources can vary.\nInsulin access\nPeople with type 1 diabetes rely upon insulin injections (or pumps) to control their blood glucose levels throughout the day, in order to prevent hyperglycaemia.\nThere are numerous treatments for type 2 diabetes, which used to be referred to as non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). People that have been newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes are usually prescribed metformin, a drug which improves insulin sensitivity and reduces the liver\u2019s output of glucose. People with type 2 diabetes who do not achieve good blood sugar control with lifestyle and / or drug interventions may later be prescribed insulin to lower their blood glucose levels.\nThe cost of diabetes\nSadly, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), 1.6 million deaths are directly attributed to diabetes each year.\nOn top of this, the complications of uncontrolled diabetes can cause significant discomfort and can reduce quality of life. Complications include neuropathy (nerve damage), nephropathy (kidney damage) and retinopathy (eye damage).\nWhat is the future?\nThere are some concerning stats regarding the state of diabetes worldwide, but it is not all doom and gloom.\nDevelopments such as the rise of low carb and technology such as the Freestyle Libre and artificial pancreas show that progress is being made in bettering people\u2019s diabetes control. People with type 2 diabetes are now able to put the condition into remissio, and this is significant, particularly as healthcare professionals had once assumed type 2 was a chronic, progressive disease.\nDiabetes and insulin access worldwide - Click Here to Read",
