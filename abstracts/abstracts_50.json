        "AB": "BACKGROUND: In patients with type 2 diabetes, intensive blood-glucose control with insulin or sulphonylurea therapy decreases progression of microvascular disease and may also reduce the risk of heart attacks. This study investigated whether intensive glucose control with metformin has any specific advantage or disadvantage. METHODS: Of 4075 patients recruited to UKPDS in 15 centres, 1704 overweight (>120% ideal bodyweight) patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes, mean age 53 years, had raised fasting plasma glucose (FPG; 6.1-15.0 mmol/L) without hyperglycaemic symptoms after 3 months' initial diet. 753 were included in a randomised controlled trial, median duration 10.7 years, of conventional policy, primarily with diet alone (n=411) versus intensive blood-glucose control policy with metformin, aiming for FPG below 6 mmol/L (n=342). A secondary analysis compared the 342 patients allocated metformin with 951 overweight patients allocated intensive blood-glucose control with chlorpropamide (n=265), glibenclamide (n=277), or insulin (n=409). The primary outcome measures were aggregates of any diabetes-related clinical endpoint, diabetes-related death, and all-cause mortality. In a supplementary randomised controlled trial, 537 non-overweight and overweight patients, mean age 59 years, who were already on maximum sulphonylurea therapy but had raised FPG (6.1-15.0 mmol/L) were allocated continuing sulphonylurea therapy alone (n=269) or addition of metformin (n=268). FINDINGS: Median glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) was 7.4% in the metformin group compared with 8.0% in the conventional group. Patients allocated metformin, compared with the conventional group, had risk reductions of 32% (95% CI 13-47, p=0.002) for any diabetes-related endpoint, 42% for diabetes-related death (9-63, p=0.017), and 36% for all-cause mortality (9-55, p=0.011). Among patients allocated intensive blood-glucose control, metformin showed a greater effect than chlorpropamide, glibenclamide, or insulin for any diabetes-related endpoint (p=0.0034), all-cause mortality (p=0.021), and stroke (p=0.032). Early addition of metformin in sulphonylurea-treated patients was associated with an increased risk of diabetes-related death (96% increased risk [95% CI 2-275], p=0.039) compared with continued sulphonylurea alone. A combined analysis of the main and supplementary studies showed fewer metformin-allocated patients having diabetes-related endpoints (risk reduction 19% [2-33], p=0.033). Epidemiological assessment of the possible association of death from diabetes-related causes with the concurrent therapy of diabetes in 4416 patients did not show an increased risk in diabetes-related death in patients treated with a combination of sulphonylurea and metformin (risk reduction 5% [-33 to 32], p=0.78). INTERPRETATION: Since intensive glucose control with metformin appears to decrease the risk of diabetes-related endpoints in overweight diabetic patients, and is associated with less weight gain and fewer hypoglycaemic attacks than are insulin and sulphonylureas, it may be the first-line pharmacological therapy of choice in these patients.",

        "AB": "To evaluate the effect of multifactorial intervention on the onset and progression of diabetic kidney disease in the patients with type 2 diabetes, we analyzed the effects of intensified multifactorial intervention by step-wise intensification of medications and life-style modifications (intensive therapy treatment targets; HbA1c under 6.2%, blood pressure under 120/75 mmHg, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol under 80 mg/dL) comparing with the guideline-based standard care (conventional therapy treatment targets: HbA1c under 6.9%, blood pressure under 130/80 mmHg, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol under 120 mg/dL) on diabetic kidney disease. A total of 2540 eligible patients in the Japan Diabetes Optimal Integrated Treatment for three major risk factors of cardiovascular diseases (J-DOIT3) cohort were randomly assigned to intensive therapy (1269) and conventional therapy (1271) and treated for a median of 8.5 years. The prespecified kidney outcome measure was a composite of progression from normoalbuminuria to microalbuminuria or progression from normoalbuminuria to macroalbuminuria or progression from microalbuminuria to macroalbuminuria, serum creatinine levels elevated by two-fold or more compared to baseline, or kidney failure. Primary analysis was carried out on the intention-to-treat population. Changes in the estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria were also analyzed. A total of 438 kidney events occurred (181 in the intensive therapy group and 257 in the conventional therapy group). Intensive therapy was associated with a significant 32% reduction in kidney events compared to conventional therapy and was associated with a change in HbA1c at one year from study initiation. Thus, prespecified analysis shows that intensified multifactorial intervention significantly reduced the onset and progression of diabetic kidney disease compared to currently recommended care.",

This in turn results in imbalance leading to the diabetic patients' daily activity disparity. The present investigation was conducted to specifically study the effects of combined training (resistance-aerobic) on serum kinesin-1 and physical function in type 2 diabetes patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. 24 diabetic neuropathic females were randomly to be selected out and divided into two experimental and control groups. The experimental group received resistance-aerobic training for 3 sessions during eight weeks. The exercise training included resistance exercises with 2-3 sets, 6-7 exercise stations, 8-12 repetitions (reps), and 3-5 minutes of rest in between the exercises, and the aerobic exercises contained 50-65% of heart rate reserve (HRR) for 3 minutes with 30 seconds of rest interval between sets and 5-10 repetitions. Results show that the serum kinesin-1 level and aerobic endurance declined after eight weeks of combined (resistance-aerobic) exercise training, but this decrease was not significant. The upper body strength increased but it was not significant, while the lower body showed a significant strength increase. With regard to the progressive nature of diabetic peripheral neuropathy, it seems that even the little changes resulting from the combined exercise training can be useful. Nevertheless, more research is required in this area.",

        "AB": "BACKGROUND: Lithium is the gold-standard treatment for bipolar disorder, is highly effective in treating major depressive disorder, and has anti-suicidal properties. However, clinicians are increasingly avoiding lithium largely due to fears of renal toxicity. Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus (NDI) occurs in 15-20% of lithium users and predicts a 2-3 times increased risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD). We recently found that use of statins is associated with lower NDI risk in a cross-sectional study. In this current paper, we describe the methodology of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to treat lithium-induced NDI using atorvastatin. METHODS: We will conduct a 12-week, double-blind placebo-controlled RCT of atorvastatin for lithium-induced NDI at McGill University, Montreal, Canada. We will recruit 60 current lithium users, aged 18-85, who have indicators of NDI, which we defined as urine osmolality (UOsm) <\u2009600\u00a0mOsm/kg after 10-h fluid restriction. We will randomize patients to atorvastatin (20\u00a0mg/day) or placebo for 12\u00a0weeks. We will examine whether this improves measures of NDI: UOsm and aquaporin (AQP2) excretion at 12-week follow-up, adjusted for baseline. RESULTS: Not applicable. CONCLUSION: The aim of this clinical trial is to provide preliminary data about the efficacy of atorvastatin in treating NDI. If successful, lithium could theoretically be used more safely in patients with a reduced subsequent risk of CKD, hypernatremia, and acute kidney injury (AKI). If future definitive trials confirm this, this could potentially allow more patients to benefit from lithium, while minimizing renal risk. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02967653 .

        "AB": "BACKGROUND: Therapeutic footwear becomes the first treatment line in the prevention of diabetic foot ulcer and future complications of diabetes. Previous studies and the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot have described therapeutic footwear as a protective factor to reduce the risk of re-ulceration. In this study, we aimed to analyze the efficacy of a rigid rocker sole to reduce the recurrence rate of plantar ulcers in patients with diabetic foot. METHODS: Between June 2016 and December 2017, we conducted a randomized controlled trial in a specialized diabetic foot unit. PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTION: Fifty-one patients with diabetic neuropathy who had a recently healed plantar ulcer were randomized consecutively into the following two groups: therapeutic footwear with semi-rigid sole (control) or therapeutic footwear with a rigid rocker sole (experimental). All patients included in the study were followed up for 6 months (one visit each 30 \u00b1 2 days) or until the development of a recurrence event. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Primary outcome measure was recurrence of ulcers in the plantar aspect of the foot. FINDINGS: A total of 51 patients were randomized to the control and experimental groups. The median follow-up time was 26 [IQR-4.4-26.1] weeks for both groups. On an intention-to-treat basis, 16 (64%) and 6 (23%) patients in the control and experimental groups had ulcer recurrence, respectively. Among the group with >60% adherence to therapeutic footwear, multivariate analysis showed that the rigid rocker sole improved ulcer recurrence-free survival time in diabetes patients with polyneuropathy and DFU history (P = 0.019; 95% confidence interval, 0.086-0.807; hazard ratio, 0.263). CONCLUSIONS: We recommend the use of therapeutic footwear with a rigid rocker sole in patients with diabetes with polyneuropathy and history of diabetic foot ulcer to reduce the risk of plantar ulcer recurrence.

        "AB": "OBJECTIVE: Lithium remains an important treatment for mood disorders but is associated with kidney disease. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is associated with up to 3-fold risk of incident chronic kidney disease among lithium users. There are limited randomized controlled trials (RCT) for treatments of lithium-induced NDI, and existing therapies can be poorly tolerated. Therefore, novel treatments are needed for lithium-induced NDI. METHOD: We conducted a 12-week double-blind pilot RCT to assess the feasibility and efficacy of 20\u00a0mg/d atorvastatin vs placebo in the treatment of NDI in chronic lithium users. Patients, recruited between September 2017 and October 2018, were aged 18 to 85, currently on a stable dose of lithium, and determined to have NDI. RESULTS: Urinary osmolality (UOsm) at 12\u00a0weeks adjusted for baseline was not statistically different between groups (+39.6\u00a0mOsm/kg [95% CI, -35.3, 114.5] in atorvastatin compared to placebo groups). Secondary outcomes of fluid intake and aquaporin-2 excretions at 12\u00a0weeks adjusted for baseline were -0.13 L [95% CI, -0.54, 0.28] and 98.68 [95% CI, -190.34, 387.70], respectively. A moderate effect size was observed for improvements in baseline UOsm by \u2265100\u00a0mOsm/kg at 12\u00a0weeks in patients who received atorvastatin compared to placebo (38.45% (10/26) vs 22.58% (7/31); Cohen's d\u00a0=\u00a00.66). CONCLUSION: Among lithium users with NDI, atorvastatin 20\u00a0mg/d did not significantly improve urinary osmolality compared to placebo over a 12-week period. Larger confirmatory trials with longer follow-up periods may help to further assess the effects of statins on NDI, especially within patients with more severe NDI.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ninety patients who applied to the Health Sciences University Ulucanlar Eye Training and Research Hospital between January 2016 and January 2017 were included in this prospective randomized study. In the study, 45 diabetes mellitus patients and 45 healthy individuals were evaluated. The diabetes patients were compared in terms of HbA1c level, diabetes mellitus duration, corneal endothelial cell density, coefficient of variation, standard deviation, and hexagonality with healthy control group. RESULTS: A statistically significant difference was found in the endothelial cell densitometer, coefficient of variation, and standard deviation measurements between the diabetes mellitus patients and the control (healthy) group. But, there was no statistically significant difference between 6A (hexagonality) and central corneal thickness measurements. There was a negative correlation between HbA1c levels and diabetes mellitus times and endothelial cell densitometer values in the patients with diabetes mellitus diagnosis and standard deviation values in the positive direction. There was a statistically significant difference between diabetes mellitus patients with the diagnosis of non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy and proliferative diabetic retinopathy in the endothelial cell densitometer and standard deviation values. But there was not any statistically significant difference between coefficient of variation, 6A, and central corneal thickness values. CONCLUSION: The endothelial cell densitometer in diabetes mellitus patients with retinopathy is lower than that in healthy individuals. There is a negative correlation between retinopathy severity and corneal endothelial cell density. Diabetes affects negatively not only vascular tissues but also avascular cornea.",

        "AB": "BACKGROUND: Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is one of the most common complications of diabetes mellitus. The main clinical manifestations of DPN include pain, numbness, paraesthesia, and weakness of the lower limbs which often leads to diabetic foot ulceration, eventually resulting in amputation. Based on Traditional Chinese Medicine theory, moxibustion has a great effect on treating and preventing DPN. However, randomized clinical trials done to evaluate the efficacy of this treatment are still lacking. Hence, this study is carried out to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of moxibustion therapy on diabetic peripheral neuropathy. METHODS: This study will be a pilot, interventional, randomized, 2-armed, parallel, singled-masked, controlled trial. A total of 40 diabetes mellitus patients with peripheral neuropathy will be recruited and assigned randomly into 2 groups (moxibustion group and waiting group) at a 1:1 ratio. This trial consists of an 8-week intervention period and a 4-week follow-up period. During the intervention period, the moxibustion group will take 3 moxibustion sessions per week, whereas no intervention will be done on the waiting group to act as the control group. The outcome will be assessed by an outcome assessor who is unaware of the group assignment. The primary outcome will be pain assessment measured with algometry, Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs pain scale, visual analogue scale, and neuropathy pain scale. The secondary outcome will be an evaluation of functional performance capacity with 6 minutes walking test, evaluation of the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure, and serum HbA1c and albumin levels. DISCUSSION: We hope that this trial will provide valuable insights on the efficacy of moxibustion in the management of diabetic peripheral neuropathy.

        "AB": "To examine whether intensive glycemic control could decrease the frequency or severity of diabetic microvascular complications, we performed a prospective study of Japanese patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) treated with multiple insulin injection treatment. A total of 110 patients with NIDDM was randomly assigned to multiple insulin injection treatment group (MIT group) or to conventional insulin injection treatment group (CIT group). Fifty-five NIDDM patients who showed no retinopathy and urinary albumin excretions < 30 mg/24 h at the baseline were evaluated in the primary-prevention cohort, and the other 55 NIDDM patients who showed simple retinopathy and urinary albumin excretions < 300 mg/24 h were evaluated in the secondary-intervention cohort. The appearance and the progression of retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy were evaluated every 6 months over a 6-year period. The worsening of complications in this study was defined as an increase of 2 or more steps in the 19 stages of the modified ETDRS interim scale for retinopathy and an increase of one or more steps in 3 stages (normoalbuminuria, microalbuminuria and albuminuria) for nephropathy. The cumulative percentages of the development and the progression in retinopathy after 6 years were 7.7% for the MIT group and 32.0% for the CIT group in the primary-prevention cohort (P = 0.039), and 19.2% for MIT group and 44.0% for CIT group in the secondary-intervention cohort (P = 0.049). The cumulative percentages of the development and the progression in nephropathy after 6 years were 7.7% for the MIT group and 28.0% for the CIT group in the primary-prevention cohort (P = 0.032), and 11.5% and 32.0%, respectively, for the MIT and CIT groups in the secondary-intervention cohort (P = 0.044). In neurological tests after 6 years, MIT group showed significant improvement in the nerve conduction velocities, while the CIT group showed significant deterioration in the median nerve conduction velocities and vibration threshold. Although both postural hypotension and the coefficient of variation of R-R interval tended to improve in the MIT group, they deteriorated in the CIT group. In conclusion, intensive glycemic control by multiple insulin injection therapy can delay the onset and the progression of diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy in Japanese patients with NIDDM. From this study, the glycemic threshold to prevent the onset and the progression of diabetic microangiopathy is indicated as follows; HbA1c < 6.5%, FBG < 110 mg/dl, and 2-h post-prandial blood glucose concentration < 180 mg/dl.",

Implementation of intensive treatment recommendations is difficult but should be considered and probably recommended to most patients with IDDM. If intensive treatment is impractical, any improvement in glycemic control is probably beneficial. Improved glycemic control should be recommended to most patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). The use of insulin in patients with NIDDM is controversial, especially in patients who are overweight, overeating, and minimally symptomatic.",

        "AB": "OBJECTIVE: Peripheral neuropathy (PN) is one of the long-term complications of diabetes. Few studies have investigated the role of regular exercise on diabetic PN. We examined the effect of aerobic training on nerve conduction velocity and action potential amplitude in the lower limbs of men with type 2 diabetes and PN. METHODS: In a randomized controlled study, 24 volunteers diagnosed with diabetic PN were randomly assigned to exercise or control groups. Aerobic training consisted of 20-45min walking or running at 50-70% of heart rate reserve for three sessions per week over 12weeks. Before and 48h after the experimental period, nerve conduction studies were performed and blood samples were taken to be analyzed for HbA1c, fasting and 2h postprandial glucose concentration. Data were analyzed using repeated-measures ANOVA at significance level of P<0.05. RESULTS: Sural sensory nerve conduction velocity (NCV) in the exercise group significantly increased (from 35.2\u00b14.3m/s to 37.3\u00b16.2m/s) compared to the control group (P=0.007). Changes in peroneal and tibial motor NCV and nerve action potential amplitude (NAPA) in all nerves studied were not different between groups (P>0.05). Moreover, HbA1c decreased to a greater extent in the exercise group compared to the control (P=0.014). CONCLUSION: Aerobic exercise training may have the potential to hinder the progression of diabetic PN by improving NCV. Given the sparse evidence in this domain, exercise-related mechanisms need to be studied in the future.",

        "AB": "BACKGROUND: Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is known to be associated with high cardiovascular risk, but the individual impact of PAD presentations on risk of macrovascular and microvascular events has not been reliably compared in patients with type 2 diabetes. We aimed to evaluate the impact of major PAD, and its different presentations, on the 10-year risk of death, major macrovascular events, and major clinical microvascular events in these patients. METHODS: Participants in the action in diabetes and vascular disease: PreterAx and DiamicroN modified-release controlled evaluation (ADVANCE) trial and the ADVANCE-ON post-trial study were followed for a median of 5.0 (in-trial), 5.4 (post-trial), and 9.9 (overall) years. Major PAD at baseline was subdivided into lower-extremity chronic ulceration or amputation secondary to vascular disease and history of peripheral revascularization by angioplasty or surgery. RESULTS: Among 11,140 participants, 516 (4.6\u00a0%) had major PAD at baseline: 300 (2.7\u00a0%) had lower-extremity ulceration or amputation alone, 190 (1.7\u00a0%) had peripheral revascularization alone, and 26 (0.2\u00a0%) had both presentations. All-cause mortality, major macrovascular events, and major clinical microvascular events occurred in 2265 (20.3\u00a0%), 2166 (19.4\u00a0%), and 807 (7.2\u00a0%) participants, respectively. Compared to those without PAD, patients with major PAD had increased rates of all-cause mortality (HR 1.35, 95\u00a0% CI 1.15-1.60, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0004), and major macrovascular events (1.47 [1.23-1.75], p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), after multiple adjustments for region of origin, cardiovascular risk factors and treatments, peripheral neuropathy markers, and randomized treatments. We have also observed a trend toward an association of baseline PAD with risk of major clinical microvascular events [1.31 (0.96-1.78), p\u00a0=\u00a00.09]. These associations were comparable for patients with a lower-extremity ulceration or amputation and for those with a history of peripheral revascularization. Furthermore, the risk of retinal photocoagulation or blindness, but not renal events, increased in patients with lower-extremity ulceration or amputation [1.53 (1.01-2.30), p\u00a0=\u00a00.04]. CONCLUSIONS: Lower-extremity ulceration or amputation, and peripheral revascularization both increased the risks of death and cardiovascular events, but only lower-extremity ulceration or amputation increased the risk of severe retinopathy in patients with type 2 diabetes. Screening for major PAD and its management remain crucial for cardiovascular prevention in patients with type 2 diabetes (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00949286).",

        "AB": "AIMS: To evaluate diabetic retinopathy (DR) data from across the SUSTAIN clinical trial programme. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The SUSTAIN clinical trial programme evaluated the efficacy and safety of semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue, for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D). In SUSTAIN 6, a 2-year, pre-approval cardiovascular outcomes trial, semaglutide was associated with a significant increase in the risk of DR complications (DRC) vs placebo. DR data from across the SUSTAIN trials were evaluated, and post hoc analyses of the SUSTAIN 6 data were conducted. These included subgroup analyses to identify at-risk patients and a mediation analysis with initial change in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c; percentage-points at week 16) as a covariate, to examine the role of the magnitude of reduction in HbA1c as an intermediate factor affecting risk of DRC. RESULTS: There was no imbalance in DR adverse events across the SUSTAIN 1 to 5 and Japanese trials. The majority of the effect with semaglutide vs placebo in SUSTAIN 6 may be attributed to the magnitude and rapidity of HbA1c reduction during the first 16\u2009weeks of treatment in patients who had pre-existing DR and poor glycaemic control at baseline, and who were treated with insulin. CONCLUSIONS: Early worsening of DR is a known phenomenon associated with the rapidity and magnitude of improvement in glycaemic control with insulin; the DRC findings in SUSTAIN 6 are consistent with this. Guidance regarding the early worsening of DR is recommended with insulin. Similar recommendations may be appropriate for semaglutide.",

        "AB": "BACKGROUND: Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) are at increased risk of developing heart failure (HF). The \"Heart OMics in AGEing\" (HOMAGE) trial suggested that spironolactone had beneficial effect on fibrosis and cardiac remodelling in an at risk population, potentially slowing the progression towards HF. We compared the proteomic profile of patients with and without diabetes among patients at risk for HF in the HOMAGE trial. METHODS: Protein biomarkers (n\u2009=\u2009276) from the Olink\u00aeProseek-Multiplex cardiovascular and inflammation panels were measured in plasma collected at baseline and 9 months (or last visit) from HOMAGE trial participants including 217 patients with, and 310 without, diabetes. RESULTS: Twenty-one biomarkers were increased and five decreased in patients with diabetes compared to non-diabetics at baseline. The markers clustered mainly within inflammatory and proteolytic pathways, with granulin as the key-hub, as revealed by knowledge-induced network and subsequent gene enrichment analysis. Treatment with spironolactone in diabetic patients did not lead to large changes in biomarkers. The effects of spironolactone on NTproBNP, fibrosis biomarkers and echocardiographic measures of diastolic function were similar in patients with and without diabetes (all interaction analyses p\u2009>\u20090.05). CONCLUSIONS: Amongst patients at risk for HF, those with diabetes have higher plasma concentrations of proteins involved in inflammation and proteolysis. Diabetes does not influence the effects of spironolactone on the proteomic profile, and spironolactone produced anti-fibrotic, anti-remodelling, blood pressure and natriuretic peptide lowering effects regardless of diabetes status.\u00a0 Trial registration\u00a0NCT02556450.",

        "AB": "AIM: To test the effectiveness of nurse-led dietary diabetes insipidus (DI) bundle on the severity of postoperative fluid imbalance in pituitary region tumours. DESIGN: Blinded randomized controlled trial. METHODS: Patients aged 18-65 operated for sellar-suprasellar tumours in an Indian tertiary care centre were enrolled through total enumeration sampling and underwent randomization with allocation concealment during Sep 2018-Feb 2019. Pre-operative DI, postoperative ventilation, renal failure or decompensated diabetes mellitus were excluded. Patients in the intervention group received a nurse-led DI bundle (validated by three Delphi rounds) with four dietary components: intake of only water during thirst and avoidance of the following-added salt, high-protein foods and caffeinated drinks. Treating clinicians and the investigator assessing outcome were blinded about enrolment. Urine output, serum sodium, vasopressin requirement and hospital stay were assessed as primary outcomes. The outcome measures were monitored daily till the 6th postoperative day. Analyses were performed on 'intention-to-treat' basis, irrespective of compliance. Independent t-test and Chi-square test were used. RESULTS: Of the initial 63 patients, 50 fulfilling criteria were randomized to two groups and assessed over six days yielding 150 patient-days per group. There were no significant baseline differences between groups. The mean daily urine output was significantly lower in the DI bundle group than in control, both overall and among endonasal operated pituitary adenomas [3000.09(462.7) vs. 4095.71(896.4)ml & 2987.14(419.5) vs. 4064.73(1051)ml], with the greatest difference on the second postoperative day. Though hypernatraemia in controls became most prominent during days 2-3 and resolved in a week, it was significantly lower in the intervention group (12.7% vs. 30.7% overall, 11.4% vs. 29.4% endonasal adenomas). The need for vasopressin analogues and hospital stay were also significantly lower with DI bundle (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). CONCLUSION: This is probably the first ever report of dietary DI bundle among operated pituitary patients, which seem to flatten the DI trend with significant benefits in polyuria, hypernatraemia, vasopressin requirement and hospital stay. TRIAL REGISTRATION: CTRI/2018/07/015127 of ICMR. IMPACT: The nurse-led dietary DI bundle has effectively reduced the severity of DI among operated pituitary patients with significant benefits in polyuria, hypernatraemia, vasopressin requirement and hospital stay. Its implementation is simple and easy to carry out, especially in resource-constrained institutions, where continuous monitoring and repeated serum sodium estimation are difficult.",

More than a decade ago the question was raised of whether tight glycemic control would prevent or slow the progression of microvascular complications. In 1993, having studied 1441 individuals with type I diabetes randomized to either intensive glycemic control (HbA1c < 7%) or conventional glycemic control (HbA1c > 9%), it was concluded that a reduction in risk of retinopathy, neuropathy and nephropathy could be realized if near normal glycemic control were achieved. Some questions remained, however. For example, could intensive treatment be achieved in routine practice under the auspices of primary care physicians? Are the findings in this study applicable to individuals with type II diabetes? These questions are addressed through the introduction of staged diabetes management (SDM), an innovative approach to the treatment of diabetes and the prevention of its complications. SDM is designed as a data-based systematic approach to diabetes treatment that targets blood glucose control. Studied in 40 clinical sites throughout the United States and evaluated in 30 sites worldwide, SDM promises to provide appropriate clinical guidance to both primary care and specialist physicians seeking to alter current practice patterns by adopting a systematic approach to diabetes management.",

At present, patients are often treated to prevent marked hyperglycaemia, that induces symptoms such as thirst. Moderately raised glucose levels are then accepted. At present, it is uncertain whether Type II diabetes should be treated more intensively, with diet, tablet or insulin therapy to maintain near-normal glucose levels, in order to prevent the onset of complications. The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) in insulin-dependent diabetic subjects with a mean age of 27 years has indicated that intensive therapy to achieve a haemoglobin A1c level of 7.1%, compared with 9.0% in a 'standard control group', will retard the progress of diabetic microvascular disease. It is not known whether this is similarly beneficial in Type II diabetic subjects, where the main complication is cardiac disease, or whether the even better control that can be obtained with pharmaceutical therapy in Type II diabetic patients would be worthwhile. It is similarly not known whether treatment with sulphonylurea, metformin or insulin is particularly beneficial or whether any of these therapies is potentially harmful. The UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) has randomly allocated 4209 newly diagnosed Type II diabetic patients to different therapies and is determining: (a) whether improved glucose control will delay the onset of clinical complications; and (b) whether any specific therapy has advantages or disadvantages.",

        "AB": "AIM: Diabetes is associated with a high risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Optimal glycaemic control is fundamental and is traditionally monitored with self-measured glucose profiles and periodic HbA1c measurements. We investigated the effectiveness of additional use of retrospective continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in diabetic pregnancies. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a nationwide multicentre, open label, randomized, controlled trial to study pregnant women with type 1 or type 2 diabetes who were undergoing insulin therapy at gestational age <\u200916\u2009weeks, or women who were undergoing insulin treatment for gestational diabetes at gestational age\u2009<\u200930\u2009weeks. Women were randomly allocated (1:1) to intermittent use of retrospective CGM or to standard treatment. Glycaemic control was assessed by CGM for 5-7\u2009days every 6 weeks in the CGM group, while self-monitoring of blood glucose and HbA1c measurements were applied in both groups. Primary outcome was macrosomia, defined as birth weight above the 90th percentile. Secondary outcomes were glycaemic control and maternal and neonatal complications. RESULTS: Between July 2011 and September 2015, we randomized 300 pregnant women with type 1 (n\u2009=\u2009109), type 2 (n\u2009=\u200982) or with gestational (n\u2009=\u2009109) diabetes to either CGM (n\u2009=\u2009147) or standard treatment (n\u2009=\u2009153). The incidence of macrosomia was 31.0% in the CGM group and 28.4% in the standard treatment group (relative risk [RR], 1.06; 95% CI, 0.83-1.37). HbA1c levels were similar between treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: In diabetic pregnancy, use of intermittent retrospective CGM did not reduce the risk of macrosomia. CGM provides detailed information concerning glycaemic fluctuations but, as a treatment strategy, does not translate into improved pregnancy outcome.",

        "AB": "OBJECTIVE: This study assessed whether a single diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) episode is associated with cognitive declines in children with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes and whether the same is true in children who had previously been diagnosed after accounting for variations in glycemic control and other relevant factors. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 758 children, 6-18 years old, who presented with DKA in a randomized multisite clinical trial evaluating intravenous fluid protocols for DKA treatment. DKA was moderate/severe in 430 children and mild in 328 children. A total of 392 children with DKA had new onset of type 1 diabetes, and the rest were previously diagnosed. Neurocognitive assessment occurred 2-6 months after the DKA episode. A comparison group of 376 children with type 1 diabetes, but no DKA exposure, was also enrolled. RESULTS: Among all patients, moderate/severe DKA was associated with lower intelligence quotient (IQ) (\u03b2 = -0.12, P < 0.001), item-color recall (\u03b2 = -0.08, P = 0.010), and forward digit span (\u03b2 = -0.06, P = 0.04). Among newly diagnosed patients, moderate/severe DKA was associated with lower item-color recall (\u03b2 = -0.08, P = 0.04). Among previously diagnosed patients, repeated DKA exposure and higher HbA(1c) were independently associated with lower IQ (\u03b2 = -0.10 and \u03b2 = -0.09, respectively, P < 0.01) and higher HbA(1c) was associated with lower item-color recall (\u03b2 = -0.10, P = 0.007) after hypoglycemia, diabetes duration, and socioeconomic status were accounted for. CONCLUSIONS: A single DKA episode is associated with subtle memory declines soon after type 1 diabetes diagnosis. Sizable IQ declines are detectable in children with known diabetes, suggesting that DKA effects may be exacerbated in children with chronic exposure to hyperglycemia.",

        "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To assess whether the presence of microvascular complications modifies the effect of intensive glucose reduction on long-term outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using ACCORD and ACCORDION study data, we investigated the risk of the primary outcome (nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular death) or death in relation to the prerandomization type and extent of microvascular complications. Interaction terms were fitted in survival models to estimate the risk of both outcomes across levels of an overall microvascular disease score (range 0 to 100) and its individual components: diabetic nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 7.7 years, 1685 primary outcomes and 1806 deaths occurred in 9405 participants. The outcome-specific microvascular score was \u226430 in 97.9% of subjects for the primary outcome and in 98.5% for death. For participants with scores of 0 and 30, respectively, the 10-year absolute risk difference between intensive glucose control and standard treatment ranged from\u00a0-0.8% (95% CI,\u00a0-2.6, 1.1) to\u00a0-3.0%\u00a0-7.1, 1.1) for the primary outcome and from\u00a0-0.5% (-2.1, 1.1) to 0.7% (-4.2, 5.6) for mortality. Retinopathy was associated with the largest effects, with a 10-year absolute risk difference of\u00a0-6.5% (-11.1 to\u00a0-2.0) for the primary outcome and\u00a0-3.9% (-7.8 to 0.1) for mortality. CONCLUSION: This hypothesis-generating study identifies diabetic retinopathy as predictor of the beneficial effect of intensive glucose control on the risk of cardiovascular disease and possibly death. Further long-term studies are required to confirm these findings.",

        "AB": "OBJECTIVES: To examine the effects of a 6-month nurse case manager (NCM) intervention compared to standard care (SC) on glycemic control and diabetes distress in a Canadian tertiary-care setting. METHODS: We recruited 140 adults with type 2 diabetes and glycated hemoglobin (A1C) levels >8% (64\u2009mmol/mol) from 2 tertiary care facilities and randomized them to: 1) a 6-month NCM intervention in addition to SC or 2) SC by the primary endocrinologists. Assessments were conducted at baseline and at 6 months. Primary outcomes included A1C levels and diabetes distress scores (DDS). Secondary outcomes included body mass index, blood pressure, diabetes-related behaviour measures, depressive symptoms, self-motivation and perception of support. RESULTS: At the 6-month follow up, the NCM group experienced larger reductions in A1C levels of -0.73% compared to the SC group (p=0.027; n=134). The NCM group also showed an additional reduction of -0.40 (26% reduction) in DDS compared to those in the SC group (p=0.001; n=134). The NCM group had lower blood pressure, ate more fruit and vegetables, exercised more, checked their feet more frequently, were more motivated, were less depressed and perceived more support. There were no changes and no group differences in terms of body mass index, medication compliance or frequency of testing. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to SC, NCM intervention was more effective in improving glycemic control and reducing diabetes distress. It is, therefore, a viable adjunct to standard diabetes care in the tertiary care setting, particularly for patients at high risk and with poor control.",

        "AB": "OBJECTIVE: The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) and its observational follow-up Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) demonstrated the dominant role of glycemia, second only to age, as a risk factor for a first cardiovascular event in type 1 diabetes (T1D). We now investigate the association between established risk factors and the total cardiovascular disease (CVD) burden, including subsequent (i.e., recurrent) events. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: CVD events in the 1,441 DCCT/EDIC participants were analyzed separately by type (CVD death, acute myocardial infarction [MI], stroke, silent MI, angina, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty/coronary artery bypass graft [PTCA/CABG], and congestive heart failure [CHF]) or as composite outcomes (CVD or major adverse cardiovascular events [MACE]). Proportional rate models and conditional models assessed associations between risk factors and CVD outcomes. RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 29 years, 239 participants had 421 CVD events, and 120 individuals had 149 MACE. Age was the strongest risk factor for acute MI, silent MI, stroke, and PTCA/CABG, while glycemia was the strongest risk factor for CVD death, CHF, and angina, second strongest for acute MI and PTCA/CABG, third strongest for stroke, and not associated with silent MI. HbA(1c) was the strongest modifiable risk factor for a first CVD event (CVD: HR 1.38 [95% CI 1.21, 1.56] per 1% higher HbA(1c); MACE: HR 1.54 [1.30, 1.82]) and also for subsequent CVD events (CVD: incidence ratio [IR] 1.28 [95% CI 1.09, 1.51]; MACE: IR 1.89 [1.36, 2.61]). CONCLUSIONS: Intensive glycemic management is recommended to lower the risk of initial CVD events in T1D. After a first event, optimal glycemic control may reduce the risk of recurrent CVD events and should be maintained.",

        "AB": "BACKGROUND: Acupuncture is commonly used in Traditional Chinese Medicine for treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), but data from randomized controlled trials are rare. METHODS: This randomized, placebo-controlled, partially double-blinded clinical trial randomly assigned adults with confirmed type 2 diabetes-induced DPN to receive 10 sessions of needle acupuncture, laser acupuncture, or placebo laser acupuncture for 10 consecutive weeks. Treatment was provided at bilateral acupoints Ex-LE-10 (Bafeng), Ex-LE-12 (Qiduan), and ST-34 (Lianqiu). Neurological assessments, including nerve conduction studies (NCS) of sural and tibial nerves, were performed at baseline and weeks 6 and 15. Primary outcome was delta of sural sensory nerve action potential (SNAP). Secondary outcomes included further NCS values, clinical scores, and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). RESULTS: Of 180 participants, 172 completed the study. Sural SNAP and sural and tibial nerve conduction velocities improved significantly after 10 treatments when comparing needle acupuncture to placebo. Needle acupuncture showed earlier onset of action than laser acupuncture. PROMs showed larger improvements following needle and laser acupuncture than placebo, reaching significant differences for hyperesthesia and cramps following needle acupuncture and for heat sensation following laser acupuncture. CONCLUSIONS: Classical needle acupuncture had significant effects on DPN. Improvement in NCS values presumably indicates structural neuroregeneration following acupuncture.",

        "AB": "PURPOSE: To determine the effect of a supportive educational intervention based on the Orem self-care model on women with type 2 diabetes and diabetic peripheral neuropathy. DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Hospital outpatient diabetes clinic. SUBJECTS: Adult women with type 2 diabetes and mild-to-moderate diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Out of 410 patients, 120 diabetic patients were recruited and randomly assigned to trial group (N\u2009=\u200960) and control group (N\u2009=\u200960). INTERVENTION: The trial group received a designed intervention consist of one-month supportive educational program with three months of follow-up (totally four months), based on self-care requisites according to the Orem self-care regarding diabetic peripheral neuropathy. The control group only received a routine care program in the diabetes clinic. MAIN MEASUREMENTS: The main outcomes were symptoms and severity of diabetic neuropathy. Further outcomes were fasting blood sugar and glycosylated hemoglobin. RESULTS: By the end of the intervention, the number of participants reduced from 60 to 58 in the trial group and to 57 in the control group (totally 115). The intervention significantly decreased mean score of diabetic neuropathy symptoms (trial group: 3.26 vs. control group: 9.57, P\u2009=\u20090.001), severity (trial group: 5.86 vs. control group: 9.02, P\u2009=\u20090.001), fasting blood sugar (trial group: 151 vs. control group: 204, P\u2009=\u20090.001), and glycosylated hemoglobin (trial group: 7.85 vs. control group: 8.62, P\u2009=\u20090.004). CONCLUSION: Delivering a supportive-educational intervention based on the Orem self-care model on outpatient diabetes clinic can decrease the symptoms and severity of diabetic peripheral neuropathy. TRIAL REGISTRATION: It was registered in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT2015021521095N1).",

Studies have shown that patients with ARDS are better managed by a conservative as compared to liberal fluid management strategy. However, it is not known if the same fluid management principles hold true for patients with comorbid diabetes mellitus and ARDS.As diabetes mellitus results in reduced pulmonary microvascular permeability and an attenuated inflammatory response, we hypothesize that in the setting of ARDS, diabetic patients will be able to tolerate a positive fluid balance better than patients without diabetes.The Fluid and Catheter Treatment Trial (FACTT) randomized patients with ARDS to conservative versus liberal fluid management strategies. In a secondary analysis of this trial, we calculated the interaction of diabetic status and differing fluid strategies on outcomes. Propensity score subclassification matching was used to control for the differing baseline characteristics between patients with and without diabetes.Nine hundred fifty-six patients were analyzed. In a propensity score matched analysis, the difference in the effect of a conservative as compared to liberal fluid management strategy on ventilator free days was 2.23 days (95% CI: -0.97 to 5.43 days) in diabetic patients, and 2.37 days (95% CI: -0.21 to 4.95 days) in non-diabetic patients. The difference in the effect of a conservative as compared to liberal fluid management on 60 day mortality was 2% (95% CI: -11.8% to 15.8%) in diabetic patients, and -7.9% (95% CI: -21.7% to 5.9%) in non-diabetic patients.When comparing a conservative fluid management strategy to a liberal fluid management strategy, diabetic patients with ARDS did not have a statistically significant difference in outcomes than non-diabetic patients.",

        "AB": "BACKGROUND: The Treatment Options for type 2 Diabetes in Adolescent and Youth study, a randomized clinical trial of three treatments for type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in youth, demonstrated treatment failure (defined as sustained HbA1c \u22658%, or inability to wean insulin after 3\u2009months after acute metabolic decomposition) in over half of the participants. Given that binding of mononuclear cells to vascular endothelium, initiated by cellular adhesion molecules and chemokines, is an early step in vascular injury, we sought to evaluate (a) changes in cellular adhesion molecule levels during the trial; (b) effect of diabetes treatment; and (c) association of markers with HbA1c, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, nephropathy, and retinopathy. METHODS: Participants (n = 515 of 699) that had baseline assessment of adhesion molecules (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 [MCP-1], vascular cell adhesion marker [VCAM], intercellular adhesion marker [ICAM], and E-Selectin) and at least one other assessment, measured at month 12, 24, or 36, were included. RESULTS: Over 1 to 3\u2009years, significant increases in MCP-1 and decreases in VCAM (both P\u2009<\u2009.0001) concentrations were found; however, no significant interactions were identified with treatment group for any molecule. For every 1% increase in HbA1c, ICAM increased by 1.8%, VCAM by 1.5%, and E-selectin by 6.8% (all P\u2009<\u2009.0001). E-selectin increased by 3.7% and 4.2% for every 10\u2009mm Hg increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively (both P\u2009<\u2009.0001). ICAM was 10.2% higher and E-selectin was 15.5% higher in participants with microalbuminuria (both P\u2009<\u2009.01). There was no significant association of adhesion molecule levels with retinopathy. CONCLUSION: Concentrations of cellular adhesion molecules rise with increasing HbA1c in youth with T2DM, and are associated with blood pressure and microalbuminuria, markers of vascular injury.",

        "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and prognostic significance of unrecognized myocardial infarction (MI) by delayed-enhancement MRI (DE-MRI) in asymptomatic patients with diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this prospective, two-center study of asymptomatic patients without known cardiac disease (n = 120), two prespecified cohorts underwent a research MRI: 1) a high-risk group with type 1 diabetes and chronic renal insufficiency (n = 50) and 2) an average-risk group with type 2 diabetes (n = 70). The primary end point was a composite of all-cause mortality and clinical MI. RESULTS: Overall, the prevalence of unrecognized MI was 19% by DE-MRI (28% high-risk group and 13% average-risk group) and 5% by electrocardiography. During up to 5 years of follow-up with a total of 460 patient-years of follow-up, the rate of death/MI was markedly higher in patients with diabetes with (vs. without) unrecognized MI (all 44% vs. 7%, high-risk group 43% vs. 6%, and average-risk group 44% vs. 8%; all P < 0.01). After adjustment for Framingham risk score, left ventricular ejection fraction, and diabetes type, the presence of unrecognized MI by DE-MRI conferred an eightfold increase in risk of death/MI (95% CI 3.0-21.1, P < 0.0001). Addition of unrecognized MI to clinical indices significantly improved model discrimination for adverse events (integrated discrimination improvement = 0.156, P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Unrecognized MI is prevalent in asymptomatic patients with diabetes without a history of cardiac disease and confers a markedly increased risk of death and clinical MI.",

        "AB": "AIMS: To compare levels of diabetes distress in people with Type 2 diabetes treated in primary and secondary care and to examine demographic and clinical correlates that may explain potential differences in levels of distress between care settings. METHODS: People with Type 2 diabetes from 24 primary care practices (n = 774) and three secondary care clinics (n = 526) completed the Problem Areas In Diabetes questionnaire. Data on HbA1c levels and diabetes complications were derived from medical charts. Hierarchical ordinal regression analysis was used to investigate which correlates could explain the potential differences in level of diabetes distress between care settings. RESULTS: Diabetes distress levels and the prevalence of elevated diabetes distress were considerably lower in the participants treated in primary care (mean (SD) total diabetes distress score 8 (11); 4% of participants with a Problem Areas In Diabetes score \u2265 40) than in secondary care (mean (SD) total diabetes distress score 23 (21); 19% of participants with a Problem Areas In Diabetes score \u2265 40, P < 0.001). In addition to care setting, the following variables were also independently related to diabetes distress: younger age, ethnic minority status, using insulin, having a higher HbA1c level, having a higher BMI and the presence of neuropathy. Other diabetes complications were not independently associated with diabetes distress. CONCLUSIONS: In primary care, lower levels of diabetes distress were reported than in secondary care. The difference in diabetes distress between care settings can be largely, but not fully, explained by specific demographic and clinical characteristics. These results need to be interpreted with caution as they are based on two separate studies, but do call into question the need to screen for diabetes distress in people with Type 2 diabetes in primary care.",

In patients with type 1 diabetes without complications, plasma renin activity, angiotensin II and aldosterone levels were normal. In patients with diabetic nephropathy, renin levels were elevated, probably partly as a result of diuretic treatment. However, renin levels were also elevated compared to patients with other renal diseases who had similar treatment and degree of azotemia. The renal sensitivity to angiotensin II was normal in patients with uncomplicated diabetes. The reduction in glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow and increases in filtration fraction during A II infusion were equal to those in healthy controls. Nine days' captopril treatment in 15 patients with diabetic nephropathy induced an increase in renal plasma flow and a decrease in filtration fraction. The glomerular filtration rate remained unchanged. During 8 weeks' randomised enalapril or metoprolol treatment in 40 patients with diabetic nephropathy, enalapril treatment reduced proteinuria to half the initial value. Metoprolol treatment had no effect on proteinuria. Furosemide was also used and the dosage was adjusted to give equally effective blood-pressure control in both groups. During long-term treatment with captopril in patients with diabetic nephropathy, the rate of decline in kidney function over time was reduced to one-fourth the initial value even though the blood pressure was only slightly reduced. The renin angiotensin system appears to be functionally intact in diabetes mellitus and interruption by ACE inhibition reduces proteinuria both by blood pressure reduction and by an effect independent of systemic blood pressure. Long-term treatment might protect kidney function in diabetic nephropathy to a greater extent than would be expected from the blood-pressure-lowering effect alone.",

We investigated the effect of exercise training on the measures of superficial femoral artery (SFA) and neuropathic symptoms in patients with DPN. In a randomized-controlled trial, 31 volunteers with established DPN were randomly assigned to experimental or control groups. Experimental group performed cycling exercise training (50%-70% of heart rate reserve, 30-45\u00a0min, 3 sessions/week) over 12\u00a0weeks. Before and 48\u00a0h after the experimental period a 5-min flow mediated dilation (FMD) response in SFA using Color Doppler Ultrasonography, fasting glucose level, HbA1c and neuropathic score were assessed. FMD% significantly increased in the experimental group (from 3.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.1% to 5.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2%) compared to the control condition (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0001). However, no significant alteration occurred in baseline membrane diameter and intima media thickness (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05). We also observed a significant improvement in fasting glucose, HbA1c and Michigan Diabetic Neuropathy Score (MDNS) following exercise intervention (all P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Linear regression analysis indicated that the change in MDNS was significantly associated with the change in HbA1c (R Square\u00a0=\u00a00.34, standardized coefficients Beta\u00a0=\u00a0-0.58, P\u00a0=\u00a0.001) and FMD (R Square\u00a0=\u00a00.37, standardized coefficients Beta\u00a0=\u00a00.61, P\u00a0=\u00a0.001). This finding may be clinically of considerable importance as metabolic and vascular factors have been indicated to be involved in the development of DPN.",

        "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the feasibility of implementing a large-scale primary care-based diabetes prevention trial. METHODS: A feasibility cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted in British Columbia, Canada, amongst adults with prediabetes using the Facilitated Lifestyle Intervention Prescription (FLIP) vs. usual care. FLIP included lifestyle advice, a pedometer, and telephone support from a lifestyle facilitator for 6\u00a0months. Indicators of feasibility included recruitment rates of family practices, participants and facilitators, as well as feasibility and retention rates in the FLIP program and study protocols. RESULTS: Six family practices participated; 59 patients were enrolled between October 2012 and March 2013. The trial protocol was acceptable to practices and participants and had a 95% participant retention rate over the 6 months (56/59). Adherence to the intervention was high (97%), with 34 of 35 patients continuing to receive telephone calls from the facilitator for 6 months. The mean cost of the intervention was C$144 per person. Compared with control, intervention participants significantly reduced weight by 3.2 kg (95% CI, 1.7 to 4.6); body mass index by 1.2 (95% CI, 0.7 to 1.7) and waist circumference by 3 cm (95% CI, 0.3 to 5.7). CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to implement FLIP and to conduct a trial to assess effectiveness. A larger trial with longer follow up to assess progression to diabetes is warranted.",

        "AB": "OBJECTIVE: Tight, targeted control of modifiable cardiovascular risk factors can reduce cardiovascular complications and mortality in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and microalbuminuria. The effects of using an electronic \"prompt\" with a treatment algorithm to support a treat-to-target approach has not been tested in primary care. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A multicenter, cluster-randomized trial was conducted among primary care practices across Leicestershire, U.K. The primary outcome was the proportion of individuals achieving systolic and diastolic blood pressure (<130 and <80 mmHg, respectively) and total cholesterol (<3.5 mmol/L) targets at 24 months. Secondary outcomes included proportion of individuals with HbA(1c) <58 mmol/mol (<7.5%), changes in prescribing, change in the albumin-to-creatinine ratio, major adverse cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, and coding accuracy. RESULTS: A total of 2,721 individuals from 22 practices, mean age 63 years, 41% female, and 62% from black and minority ethnic groups completed 2 years of follow-up. There were no significant differences in the proportion of individuals achieving the composite primary outcome, although the proportion of individuals achieving the prespecified outcome of total cholesterol <4.0 mmol/L (odds ratio 1.24; 95% CI 1.05-1.47; P = 0.01) increased with intensive intervention compared with control. Coding for microalbuminuria increased relative to control (odds ratio 2.05; 95% CI 1.29-3.25; P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Greater improvements in composite cardiovascular risk factor control with this intervention compared with standard care were not achieved in this cohort of high-risk individuals with T2DM. However, improvements in lipid profile and coding can benefit patients with diabetes to alter the high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular events. Future studies should consider comprehensive strategies, including patient education and health care professional engagement, in the management of T2DM.",

The metabolite trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) derived via gut flora has been linked to excess ASCVD. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed data, biospecimens, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) from the prospective multicenter randomized Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial to assess its value in 330 high-risk individuals with T2D without evident atherosclerotic disease at enrollment. RESULTS: Incident cardiovascular events occurred in 165 cases; 165 controls matched by age, sex, and treatment arm experienced no incident events during follow-up. Cases and controls (mean age 64.5 years) had similar mean glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (8.2%) and mean 10-year ASCVD risk (23.5%); groups also had similar use of statins and antihypertensive medications at baseline and follow-up. Baseline plasma TMAO levels did not differ between groups after adjusting for ASCVD risk score, HbA1c, and estimated glomerular filtration rate, nor did TMAO distinguish patients suffering incident MACE from those who remained event-free. CONCLUSIONS: TMAO's prognostic value for incident ASCVD events may be blunted when applied to individuals with T2D with poor glycemic control and high baseline ASCVD risk. These results behoove further translational investigations of unique mechanisms of ASCVD risk in T2D.",

        "AB": "OBJECTIVE: Diabetes perceptions, acceptance and treatment motivation are changeable factors of adherence. This study aimed to test the effects of brief psychological interventions based on diabetes threat and mastery perceptions in terms of adherence, acceptance and motivation. Physicians may find such interventions useful during a 15-minute consultation with diabetes patients. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This randomized controlled study included 80 patients with type 2 diabetes, recruited from the hospital diabetes department, who were randomly assigned to four intervention groups based on autobiographical recall. Those in the two intervention groups were asked to recall diabetic events based on mastery and threat perceptions, respectively, whereas those in the two control groups recalled non-diabetic events based on positive and negative emotions, respectively. Following this, all participants completed validated self-questionnaires assessing diabetes perceptions, acceptance, treatment motivation and adherence. RESULTS: Patients in the threat group reported less adherence (P<0.01) and less avoidance (P<0.05), and perceived diabetes as less threatening (P<0.05) than those in the mastery group. Similar results were obtained when the threat group was compared with its matched negative-emotion control group (P<0.05, P<0.05 and P=0.087, respectively). Patients in the mastery group reported feeling a stronger sense of mastery (P<0.05) than those in their positive-emotion control group and greater treatment acceptance than those in the threat group (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: Contrary to conventional medical belief, discussing threatening personal events with patients can yield positive results. Health professionals should take threat and mastery perceptions of diabetes into account during regular consultations with a view to improving treatment acceptance and adherence. With this brief intervention of type 2 diabetes patients, it was also more effective to alleviate their emotional difficulties than to enhance their perception of mastery.",

        "AB": "BACKGROUND: The differential diagnosis of diabetes insipidus is challenging. The most reliable approaches are copeptin measurements after hypertonic saline infusion or arginine, which is a known growth hormone secretagogue but has recently also been shown to stimulate the neurohypophysis. Similar to arginine, glucagon stimulates growth hormone release, but its effect on the neurohypophysis is poorly studied. DESIGN: Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial including 22 healthy participants, 10 patients with central diabetes insipidus, and 10 patients with primary polydipsia at the University Hospital Basel, Switzerland. METHODS: Each participant underwent the glucagon test (s.c. injection of 1 mg glucagon) and placebo test. The primary objective was to determine whether glucagon stimulates copeptin and to explore whether the copeptin response differentiates between diabetes insipidus and primary polydipsia. Copeptin levels were measured at baseline, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 min after injection. RESULTS: In healthy participants, glucagon stimulated copeptin with a median increase of 7.56 (2.38; 28.03) pmol/L, while placebo had no effect (0.10 pmol/L (-0.70; 0.68); P < 0.001). In patients with diabetes insipidus, copeptin showed no relevant increase upon glucagon, with an increase of 0.55 (0.21; 1.65) pmol/L, whereas copeptin was stimulated in patients with primary polydipsia with an increase of 15.70 (5.99; 24.39) pmol/L. Using a copeptin cut-off level of 4.6pmol/L had a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI: 100-100) and a specificity of 90% (95% CI: 70-100) to discriminate between diabetes insipidus and primary polydipsia. CONCLUSION: Glucagon stimulates the neurohypophysis, and glucagon-stimulated copeptin has the potential for a safe, novel, and precise test in the differential diagnosis of diabetes insipidus.",

        "AB": "OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the study were to investigate the effectiveness of 2 types of peer-led self-management programs in bringing about improvements in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus and to determine whether there were differences in effectiveness between the 2 programs. METHODS: The study used a 3-arm randomized controlled trial design with clinical measures taken at baseline and at 6 and 12 months post-program. In total, 405 persons completed baseline questionnaires and were randomly allocated to a diabetes self-management program (n=130), to a general self-management program (n=109) or to a control group (n=122). A 2-way factorial analyses of variance was employed as the primary statistical analysis. RESULTS: The findings showed that the self-management programs had affected 5 of the 30 measures: fatigue, cognitive symptom management, self-efficacy with regard to the disease in general, communication with physician, and the score on the Diabetes Empowerment Scale. In addition, 3 variables-social role limitations, total hospital nights and glycated hemoglobin levels-showed marginally significant interaction effects. The second analysis found similar results, with 4 of the 5 measures remaining statistically significant: fatigue, cognitive symptom management, communication with physician and diabetes empowerment, with neither program being more effective than the other. CONCLUSIONS: The major findings are that although both programs were effective in bringing about positive changes in the outcome measures, there was little difference in effectiveness between the Diabetes Self-Management Program and the Chronic Disease Self-Management Program. This finding is consistent with the principle that behaviour-change strategies using self-efficacy are key components in health education programs.",

        "AB": "BACKGROUND: This is the first randomised controlled trial to assess the impact of unsupervised high-intensity interval training on cardiovascular autonomic function in adults with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: A total of 22 individuals with type 2 diabetes (age 60\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u2009years, 17 males) lay in a supine position for 20\u2009min for evaluation of cardiovascular autonomic function, which included (1) time domain measures of heart rate variability, (2) frequency domain measures of heart rate variability and blood pressure variability and (3) baroreflex receptor sensitivity. Participants were randomised into 12\u2009weeks of high-intensity interval training (3 sessions/week) or standard care control group. RESULTS: After 12\u2009weeks, the between-group change in HbA(1c) (%) was significant (high-intensity interval training: 7.13\u2009\u00b1\u20090.31 to 6.87\u2009\u00b1\u20090.29 vs Control: 7.18\u2009\u00b1\u20090.17 to 7.36\u2009\u00b1\u20090.21, p\u2009=\u20090.03). There were no significant changes in measures of heart rate variability; R-R interval (ms) (high-intensity interval training: 954\u2009\u00b1\u200949 to 973\u2009\u00b1\u200953 vs Control: 920\u2009\u00b1\u20096 to 930\u2009\u00b1\u200932, p\u2009=\u20090.672), low frequency/high frequency (high-intensity interval training: 0.90\u2009\u00b1\u20090.21 to 0.73\u2009\u00b1\u20090.07 vs Control: 1.20\u2009\u00b1\u20090.29 to 1.00\u2009\u00b1\u20090.17, p\u2009=\u20090.203), or blood pressure variability; systolic blood pressure low frequency/high frequency (high-intensity interval training: 0.86\u2009\u00b1\u20090.21 to 0.73\u2009\u00b1\u20090.10 vs Control: 1.06\u2009\u00b1\u20090.26 to 0.91\u2009\u00b1\u20090.14, p\u2009=\u20090.169). At baseline, HbA(1c) was negatively correlated with baroreflex receptor sensitivity ( r\u2009=\u2009-0.592, p\u2009<\u20090.01). CONCLUSION: High-intensity interval training improves glycaemic control but has limited effect on cardiovascular autonomic regulation in patients with type 2 diabetes.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is an interventional quasi-experimental study carried out in 4 community health centers in Andimeshk City in Iran in 2017. Of 160 patients 80 cases were randomly assigned as intervention group and 80 patients as the control one. A three-section questionnaire completed by a face-to-face interviewing used for data collection before and after the intervention and three months after the education. Fasting Blood Sugar (FBS) and Hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) tests were done for both groups in a single laboratory before and three months after training. RESULTS: The mean age of patients in intervention group was 48.11\u202f\u00b1\u202f9.7 and control group was 47.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f7.9 years. The awareness of the patients related to diabetes foot care, in the intervention group after the training significantly improved (P\u202f<\u202f0.001). The mean scores of preventive behaviors of diabetic foot significantly increased in the intervention group (P\u202f<\u202f0.001). CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that educational intervention based on short message service (SMS), resulting in improve foot care knowledge, foot care practices and metabolic control in patients with diabetes type 2.",

        "AB": "OBJECTIVES: Diabetes knowledge among kidney transplant recipients with posttransplant diabetes has not been exhaustively assessed. Here, we evaluated the effects of structured diabetes education on development of diabetic micro- and macroangiopathies in kidney transplant patients with posttransplant diabetes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective randomized controlled study categorized 210 renal transplant patients with posttransplant diabetes mellitus into 2:1 groups according to type of diabetes education. Group 1 (n = 140) received structured education, and group 2 (n = 70) received conventional education. Patient data were collected through patient identification and metabolic control parameter forms. RESULTS: Most patients in groups 1 and 2, respectively, were Kuwaiti (60.7% vs 58.6%), men (57.9% vs 68.6%), and had high school-level education (43.6% vs 48.6%). Chronic glomerulonephritis was the original disease in 36.4% versus 35.4% of patients. Most patients (72.8% vs 78.6% in group 1 vs 2) received pretransplant hemodialysis. At study start, the rate of patients with diabetic neuropathy was comparable between groups (32.4% vs 27.9%). Moreover, after completion of 24 months of education, neurological evaluation by electromyograph and nerve conduction studies did not show any significant differences between the groups (P > .05). Similarly, the number of patients with fundus imaging showing retinopathy was comparable between groups at start and end of study (P > .05). Although macroangiopathic events were higher in group 1, this finding was not significant (P > .05). However, although the percentage of patients with nephropathy was comparable in both groups at start of study, the percentage decreased significantly in group 1 at 24 months after completion of education compared with group 2 and baseline value (P = .016). CONCLUSIONS: Structured diabetes education was associated with reduced diabetic nephropathy but had no significant effects on other micro- or macroangiopathies. However, we recommend education for all kidney transplant recipients with diabetes.",

This multi-center, prospective, randomized, intervention trial of 5102 newly-diagnosed patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus was aimed at determining whether improved blood glucose control can prevent complications and reduce associated morbidity and mortality. THE RESULTS: Improved blood glucose control was shown to reduce the number of complications, mainly by reducing the effect of microangiopathy. There was however no reduction in the number of diabetes-related deaths nor in the risk of myocardial infarction or sudden death. CONTROVERSY OVER CALCIUM ANTAGONISTS: Calcium antagonists are suspected of increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease. On the basis of published reports, the JNC VI guidelines are recommended: calcium antagonists should not be used as first line treatment in diabetics. RECENT DRUGS: Acarbose, an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, lowers post-prandial blood glucose level. It has marketing approval for single-drug regimens in France. Miglitol, another alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, would have the same therapeutic effect. Orliatort, an gastro-intestinal lipase inhibitor, is indicated in obese patients but long-term results are lacking to evaluate effects in diabetics.",

        "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the benefits of early photocoagulation in patients with type I versus type II diabetes. DESIGN: One eye of each of 3,711 patients was randomly assigned to early photocoagulation; the other was assigned to deferral of photocoagulation, with follow-up visits scheduled every 4 months and photocoagulation to be carried out promptly if high-risk proliferative retinopathy developed. Patients were categorized by age and type of diabetes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Best corrected visual acuity was measured at each study visit scheduled at 4-month intervals. Stereoscopic fundus photographs were taken and evaluated at baseline, 4 months, and yearly thereafter. Retinopathy severity was assessed from fundus photographs. Severe visual loss was defined as visual acuity of worse than 5/200 for at least two consecutive study visits. RESULTS: Previously published results of the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) demonstrated a statistically significant benefit of early photocoagulation in preventing severe vision loss. Further analyses demonstrate that this benefit of early photocoagulation is greater in patients with type II diabetes than in those with type I. The relative benefit of early photocoagulation in patients with type II diabetes is also seen for other outcomes (development of high-risk proliferative retinopathy, development of the combined end point [severe visual loss or vitrectomy], development of moderate visual loss, or development of legal blindness). The patients most likely to benefit from early photocoagulation had severe nonproliferative retinopathy or early proliferative retinopathy. Analyses from the Diabetic Retinopathy Study confirm the relative benefit of scatter photocoagulation for type II patients. Because of the high correlation between age and type of diabetes, analyses sub-grouped by age show similar results. CONCLUSION: These analyses suggest that patients with type II diabetes, or older patients with diabetes, are more likely to benefit from early scatter photocoagulation than patients with type I diabetes. The current standard of care is to initiate scatter photocoagulation as the severity of retinopathy approaches or reaches the high-risk stage, Provided careful follow-up is possible, ETDRS data do not show that initiating scatter photocoagulation prior to the development of high-risk proliferative diabetic retinopathy in patients with type I diabetes will reduce the risk of severe visual loss. ETDRS analyses do indicate that for patients with type II diabetes, it is especially important to consider scatter photocoagulation at the time of the development of severe nonproliferative or early proliferative retinopathy.",

Long-term comparison data between the biodegradable polymer-coated biolimus-eluting stent (BES; Nobori\u00ae) and the second-generation durable polymer-coated everolimus-eluting stent (EES; XIENCE V\u00ae or XIENCE PRIME\u00ae or PROMUS\u2122) in diabetic patients are scarce. METHODS: The COMPARE II trial was an investigator-initiated, multicenter, open-label, randomized, all-comers trial which assigned patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in a 2:1 fashion to either BES or EES. We analyzed the safety and efficacy outcomes in diabetic patients at 5\u202fyear follow-up. The primary pre-specified composite endpoint major adverse cardiac event (MACE) was defined as cardiac death, non-fatal target-vessel myocardial infarction (TV-MI), or clinically indicated target vessel revascularization (CD-TVR). RESULTS: Out of 2707 study patients, 588 were diabetics (21.7%) of whom 391 were treated with BES and 197 with EES. At 5\u202fyears follow-up, MACE occurred in 87 patients (22.2%) in the BES group and in 34 patients (17.2%) in the EES group (p\u202f=\u202f.34). Other safety and efficacy endpoints did not differ between stent groups. CONCLUSIONS: At 5\u202fyears follow-up, no differences in terms of MACE as well as all analyzed safety and efficacy measures, including stent thrombosis, between the biodegradable polymer-coated BES and the durable polymer-coated EES in diabetic patients were observed.",

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In a secondary analysis of women in the DCCT/EDIC (n = 657), outcomes were the cumulative incidences of natural menopause and surgical menopause. Cox regression analyses were used to examine associations with treatment group, time-varying estimates of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), insulin dosage, BMI, and microvascular complications (retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy). RESULTS By EDIC year 18, after an average of 28 years of follow-up, 240 (38%) women had experienced natural menopause and 115 (18%) women had experienced surgical menopause. Age at natural menopause was similar in the intensive versus conventional groups (49.9 vs. 49.0 years; P = 0.28), and age at surgical menopause was similar in the intensive versus conventional groups (40.8 vs. 42.0 years; P = 0.31). In multivariable models, treatment group, HbA1c, and microvascular complications were not associated with risk of natural or surgical menopause. Each 10 unit/day increase in insulin dosage decreased risk of natural menopause (hazard ratio [HR] 0.91, 95% CI 0.75-0.98) and each kg/m(2) increase in BMI increased risk of surgical menopause (HR 1.08, 95% CI 1.00-1.16). CONCLUSIONS In the DCCT/EDIC, intensive versus conventional treatment group and HbA1c level were not associated with menopause risk. Greater insulin dose was associated with lower menopause risk.",

METHOD: Randomized multicenter cross-sectional study conducted in 2015 in primary care with 129 diabetics. It included sociodemographic variables, microvascular and macrovascular complications, organic damage, comorbidity and lifestyles of smoking, exercise and adherence to Mediterranean diet. Metabolic control was assessed with the latest annual glycosylated haemoglobin. RESULTS: 57% were men and 43% women. Metabolic control was acceptable (HbAc1%, 7.15%) without differences by town. 74.4% had cardiovascular comorbidity and the 99.2% risk factors. 23% were smokers and 41% sedentary with a 56% adherence to Mediterranean diet. CONCLUSIONS: The cardiometabolic profile of diabetes includes retinopathy, peripheral arterial disease, comorbidity of hypertension and cardiovascular risk factors. Individual or group health education in self-care and healthy lifestyles can improve metabolic control.",

METHODS: The associations between age (or age at diagnosis), diabetes duration and major macrovascular events, all-cause death and major microvascular events were examined in 11,140 patients with type 2 diabetes randomly allocated to intensive or standard glucose control in the Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron Modified Release Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE) trial. Rates were calculated by 5 year baseline age (or age at diagnosis) and diabetes duration strata. Risks were estimated using Cox models adjusted for treatment assignment and HbA1c. RESULTS: The mean age (\u00b1SD) was 65.8\u2009\u00b1\u20096.4 years, age at diagnosis was 57.8\u2009\u00b1\u20098.7 years and diabetes duration was 7.9\u2009\u00b1\u20096.4 years. Diabetes duration was associated with the risk of macrovascular events (HR 1.13 [95% CI 1.08, 1.17]), microvascular events (1.28 [1.23, 1.33]) and death (1.15 [1.10, 1.20]) whereas age (or age at diagnosis) was only associated with the risk of macrovascular events (1.33 [1.27, 1.39]) and death (1.56 [1.48, 1.64]). No interaction was observed between diabetes duration, age and the risk of macrovascular events or death (both p\u2009>\u20090.4). However, an interaction was observed between diabetes duration, age and the risk of microvascular events (p\u2009=\u20090.002), such that the effects of increasing diabetes duration were greatest at younger rather than older age. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In patients with type 2 diabetes, age or age at diagnosis and diabetes duration are independently associated with macrovascular events and death whereas only diabetes duration is independently associated with microvascular events and this effect is greater in the youngest patients.",

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We identified 1,200 health plan members who were overdue for diabetes-related testing and randomly allocated 600 to ATO-SR and 600 to usual care (no intervention). The intervention included three interactive calls encouraging recommended testing. The primary outcome was retinopathy testing, since this was the health plan's principal goal. Tests for glycemia, hyperlipidemia, and nephropathy were secondary outcomes. RESULTS: In total, 232 participants (39%) verbally responded to the calls. There was no difference between the intervention and the usual care groups in the primary outcome (adjusted hazard ratio 0.93 [95% CI 0.71-1.22]) and no effect of the intervention on any of the secondary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Fewer than 40% of the patients randomized to ATO-SR interacted verbally with the system. The intervention had no effect on the study's outcomes.",

        "AB": "The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial has demonstrated that intensive diabetes treatment delays the onset and slows the progression of diabetic complications in subjects with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus from 13 to 39 years of age. We examined whether the effects of such treatment also occurred in the subset of young diabetic subjects (13 to 17 years of age at entry) in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial. One hundred twenty-five adolescent subjects with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus but with no retinopathy at baseline (primary prevention cohort) and 70 adolescent subjects with mild retinopathy (secondary intervention cohort) were randomly assigned to receive either (1) intensive therapy with an external insulin pump or at least three daily insulin injections, together with frequent daily blood-glucose monitoring, or (2) conventional therapy with one or two daily insulin injections and once-daily monitoring. Subjects were followed for a mean of 7.4 years (4 to 9 years). In the primary prevention cohort, intensive therapy decreased the risk of having retinopathy by 53% (95% confidence interval: 1% to 78%; p = 0.048) in comparison with conventional therapy. In the secondary intervention cohort, intensive therapy decreased the risk of retinopathy progression by 70% (95% confidence interval: 25% to 88%; p = 0.010) and the occurrence of microalbuminuria by 55% (95% confidence interval: 3% to 79%; p = 0.042). Motor and sensory nerve conduction velocities were faster in intensively treated subjects. The major adverse event with intensive therapy was a nearly threefold increase of severe hypoglycemia. We conclude that intensive therapy effectively delays the onset and slows the progression of diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy when initiated in adolescent subjects; the benefits outweigh the increased risk of hypoglycemia that accompanies such treatment.",

        "PG": "466-74",
        "AB": "BACKGROUND: The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT)/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications(EDIC) studies have established multiyear mean hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) as predictive of microvascular complications in persons with type 1 diabetes. However, multiyear mean HbA1c is not always available in the clinical setting. Skin advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are thought to partially reflect effects of hyperglycemia over time, and measurement of skin AGEs might be a surrogate for multiyear mean HbA1c. As certain AGEs fluoresce and skin fluorescence has been demonstrated to correlate with the concentration of skin AGEs, noninvasive measurement by skin intrinsic fluorescence(SIF) facilitates the exploration of the association of mean HbA1c and other clinical/technical factors with SIF using the detailed phenotypic database available in DCCT/EDIC. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Of the subjects, 1,185 (53% male) had measurements of SIF during years 16/17 of EDIC with mean age and diabetes duration of 51.5 and 29.8 years, respectively. SIF measurements were obtained on the underside of the forearm near the elbow using a skin fluorescence spectrometer. Demographic data and health history were self-reported, and an annual standardized examination measured clinical status. Linear regression models were constructed to identify significant clinical and technical factors associated with SIF, and the final models only used factors that were significant. RESULTS: SIF ranged from 8.7 to 54.0 arbitrary units and was log-normally distributed. Log(SIF) correlated more with mean HbA1c as the time period increased. In multivariate analyses log(SIF) was significantly associated with mean HbA1c, age,estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60mL/min/m2, smoking status, skin tone, and clinic latitude <37 N. CONCLUSIONS: SIF reflects age, mean HbA1c over time, smoking, and renal damage, which are known risk factors for diabetes complications.",

METHODS: People with Type 2 diabetes and a recent first acute coronary event (n = 201) were randomized to the intervention group (three home visits by a diabetes nurse) or the attention control group (one telephone consultation). Outcomes were measured after discharge (baseline) and at 5 months (follow-up) using validated questionnaires for diabetes-related distress (Problem Areas in Diabetes), well-being (WHO Well-Being Index) and health status (Euroqol 5 Dimensions; Euroqol Visual Analogue Scale). ancova was used to analyse change-over-time differences between groups. RESULTS: Follow-up data were available for 81 participants in the intervention group (66.0 \u00b1 9.3 years, 76% male) and 80 in the control group (65.6 \u00b1 9.4 years, 75% male) participants. Mean diabetes-related distress was low after hospital discharge (intervention group: 8.2 \u00b1 10.1; control group: 9.2 \u00b1 12.4) and did not change after 5 months (intervention group: 9.2 \u00b1 12.4; control group: 9.0 \u00b1 11.2). Baseline well-being was less favourable but improved significantly in the intervention group (baseline: 58.5 \u00b1 28.0; follow-up: 65.5 \u00b1 23.7; P = 0.005), but not in the control group (baseline: 57.5 \u00b1 25.2; follow-up: 59.6 \u00b1 24.4; P = 0.481). Health status also improved in the intervention group (baseline: 69.9 \u00b1 17.3; follow-up: 76.8 \u00b1 15.6; P < 0.001) but not in the control group (baseline: 68.6 \u00b1 15.9; follow-up: 69.9 \u00b1 16.7; P = 0.470). A significant group effect was found for health status (F = 7.9; P = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Although the intervention had no effect on diabetes-related distress, this might be at least partially attributable to very low levels of diabetes-related distress at baseline. Interestingly, health status scores and well-being, which were less favourable at baseline, both improved after the tailored support intervention.",
