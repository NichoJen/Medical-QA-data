It is better to have a strict diabetic diet and sugar levels within the normal range and have HbA1c less than 6. Frankly speaking, I feel that during conception, less than 6 or 5 would be better but at 10, it is advised not to conceive but I think after conception it would have increased. As with high sugar levels, more chances of congenital anomalies in the fetus are there, most popular is heart defects.\nThe baby could have diabetes and could grow fast due to sugar levels imbalance and can be large for the gestational age. It can have stillbirth, difficult delivery, intrauterine death, etc. Please contact maternal medicine consultant obstetrician and discuss your detailed history and treatment till now. In pregnancy, Insulin is preferred over oral medications. Have a strict diabetic diet, daily walk, yoga, or mild exercises. Try to have strict monitoring of fetus as well as your sugar levels. Things could be well only with strict diabetic treatment and precautions for the whole pregnancy.Was this answer helpful?\u00a0|\u00a0Same symptoms doesn\u2019t mean you have the same problem.

We think that it is underweight. My weight before pregnancy was 44 kilograms, and now, it is 48.5 kilograms. When I asked my doctor, they told me that my weight and height are not much, so the baby's weight is also growing up accordingly. My mind is not getting convinced still. I have reduced food intake due to gestation and consuming more protein-rich and carb-less food. When I take more food slightly than the regular intake, my sugar level increases. This is so confusing whether I need to convince my mind that my baby weight is good enough or do I need to increase my intake of food to increase both my body and baby weight? Please suggest.\n",
        "a_text": "\n#\nHi,\nWelcome to icliniq.com.\nI understand your concern. Your doctor is correct in saying that babies' weight depends on the mother's weight and height. If the mother is taller and healthier, the baby remains bigger than the baby of a short and petite mother. Hence 2.3 kilogram baby may be a good weight considering your height and weight. Also, at 36 weeks, 2.3 kilograms are normal. As in the next four weeks, the baby may gain up to a kilogram weight.\nIf you have been getting scans regularly, your doctor measures other aspects of the baby like head circumference, abdominal circumference, long bone length, and diameter of the baby's head, and a graph is maintained. On a follow-up scan, the doctor sees that all the other parameters are increasing adequately along with weight. Hence a small size baby (lesser weight) with all other normal parameters is considered constitutionally small (normal but a small baby). Also, as suggested by the doctor, eating fewer calories will not affect the baby's weight as whatever you consume is converted to food for your baby. So if you are still not convinced, kindly send me all your scans. I will have a look through and explain in much more detail.

        "a_text": "\n#\nHello,Welcome to icliniq.com.Thanks for the query.Diabetes during pregnancy has to be managed systematically, and a diabetologist cannot handle a pregnant mother. The dosing of insulin depends on the mother's weight and the multiplication factor for the first trimester. Insulin shows immediate sugar control within 24 hours. But simple blood sugar profile is not recommended for calibrating dosing for pregnant women. It would help if you got an OGTT (oral glucose tolerance test) with 75 g glucose and fasting for 12 hours before the test.Then the requirement of insulin could be ascertained and calculated for the mother. It is just 5 weeks and early pregnancy; the viability needs to be established by the arrival of heart rate. The chances of missed abortions are high in uncontrolled diabetic mothers.Please follow up with all the reports for evaluation and advice.Regards.Was this answer helpful?\u00a0|\u00a0Same symptoms doesn\u2019t mean you have the same problem.

These tablets may increase the requirement of antidiabetic medicines (tablets/insulin). So, she needs to monitor her blood sugar level (at least two to three times during the period she is taking tablets) to make sure that sugar control is fine.\nContraceptive pills used nowadays are low dose pills and have little or no impact on diabetes. Even if sugar levels increase, it can be treated by increasing the dose of antidiabetic medicines. So, she can use low dose contraceptive pills. Just consult your physician before starting those pills to make sure that the medicines do not interact with each other.\nDuring pregnancy, if her sugar control is fine from three months before pregnancy, during pregnancy and till delivery of the baby, there will practically be no problem to the mother and baby. If sugar control is not good, there may be many problems about which there is no need to worry right now.\nRevert back to a gynaecologist online for further queries --> https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/obstetrician-and-gynaecologistWas this answer helpful?\u00a0|\u00a0Same symptoms doesn\u2019t mean you have the same problem.

She was diagnosed with type-2 diabetes with HbA1c of 10 three months back and was prescribed with Jalra (50/500), Invokana (100). We consulted a dietitian as well and went on exercise with full diet control. Took the HbA1c results yesterday and was found to be 5.6 with CBC-hemoglobin-13.2.Her doctor was surprised and was not able to believe. He changed the medication to Melmet SR 500 mg and retained Invokana and told us to take it for next three months. Please advise us whether to go on with the tablets as we heard that for this level of HbA1c tablets are not required? We want to fight it with diet and exercise.We want to switch to Ayurveda. So, is this the right time?The doctor advised that we should compulsorily be administered with Insulin if we are planning for pregnancy. We are planning in the next year though. Please advise whether do we have to compulsorily be using Insulin? Is there no other alternative?\n",
        "a_text": "\n#\nHello,\nWelcome to icliniq.com.\nI understand your concern.\nSince there was a sudden fall in HbA1c level, your doctor might have been surprised by the change. He might want to follow up for a couple of weeks or a month to ascertain that everything is going well. That is probably why your wife is now on Melmet 500 (Metformin) which is the first-line drug for diabetes. If her blood glucose levels are stable with diet and exercise, then she will definitely be able to go off medication. But that needs to be confirmed by the doctor after subsequent testing. Her HbA1C came down to 5.6 while she was on earlier medication. Now the doctor has reduced the dosage to a minimum and your wife's reports will be followed up for further progress. Depending on the next report, your doctor will take further action. That is how it works usually. So do not be in a hurry to stop medication and do not make any hasty decisions.\nRegarding the efficiency of Ayurvedic medicine, there have been reports of effective medicines in Ayurveda, but that needs to be discussed with an Ayurveda expert. Be sure that you are consulting a doctor who practices pure Ayurveda and prescribes genuine medicines. You may be aware - all that is labeled herbal may not be ayurvedic.\nRegarding pregnancy, I think what your doctor meant is, when your wife gets pregnant, if her blood sugar is not under control, she will have to take Insulin. It is true because oral medications are not recommended in pregnancy. Insulin is the safest medicine for use in pregnancy. In case her blood sugar is normal during pregnancy (without any medication), she may not need Insulin or any other medication. But she will still need to be tested regularly to be sure that she is in the normal range. You do not have to be apprehensive about Insulin use, there are a lot of myths associated with Insulin use. It is a safe drug, easy to manage, and after pregnancy and lactation, she can slowly move to oral medication again.\nSince you have another year to plan the pregnancy, she can now focus on lifestyle modification - balanced diet and exercise - and take a decision based on how things unfold. Stay positive, stay healthy.\nFor more information consult a diabetologist online --> https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/diabetologistWas this answer helpful?\u00a0|\u00a0Same symptoms doesn\u2019t mean you have the same problem.

So, baby has not been exposed to high blood sugar.\nHad the blood sugars been high, the most affected would be the abdominal circumference (AC). The value of head circumference (HC) and AC will be almost the same at 32 weeks. Till then, HC is greater than AC. Even in our body, AC is greater than HC.\u00a0In the scan, the value of HC is greater than AC and nearly equal. So, there is no chance of high blood sugars.\nThe baby is absolutely fine.

For diabetes, the patient was taking the following medicines. A combination of Metformin 850 mg and Glimperide 1 mg in the morning and a combination of Metformin 850 mg and Glimperide 2 mg at night. His sugar was not under control, and he went to a doctor, who changed all his medicines, and later on, he tapers down the medication. After taking the above medicines, he found his RBS as 297 mg/dL, and he went to this new doctor and prescribed him Tiban 20/500 mg twice a day and Crano-D once a day (This is a combination of Manrose 600 mg and Cranberry extraction 300 mg). He measured sugar in regular intervals, and his sugar was coming down. Now he has an RBS of 100 mg/dL, and the doctor gave him Tiban 20/500 mg once a day and Crano D once a day. Now he doubts that whether he has been given heavy doses of medicines. Is the present given drugs have equal strength compared to his previous medications? Since they have a family history of CKD, they approached me to determine whether they are on the right track or misled by prescribing high doses first and then reducing slowly. Please guide, sir. \n",
        "a_text": "\n#\nHi,\nWelcome to icliniq.com.\nHi Sir, First, I wanted to be clear.\n1. Is he still taking Glimepiride and Metformin?\n2. Tiban is Teneligliptin, which I do not prescribe much. But it is safe to take 20 mg twice daily. Also, it is safe to take once daily in a person with kidney problems.\n3. Metformin can be given up to 3000 mg daily. Assuming he also took Glimepiride and Metformin. The total dose is only 2650 mg which is the maximum dose I use, as long as the kidneys are fine.\n4. Crano-D is used for recurrent urinary infections, but not sure if it is helpful or not. So, I do not know if your relative needs it.\n5. If your relative has normal kidney function now (with normal creatinine), there is no risk of high doses. I assume he has a strong CKD family history, but he does not have any kidney issues now. Overall, I think there are no issues here, and he can continue the medicines. As usual, make sure he checks HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin) once in three months and creatinine and urine albumin creatinine ratio once a year.Was this answer helpful?\u00a0|\u00a0Same symptoms doesn\u2019t mean you have the same problem.

        "a_text": "\n#\nHi,\nWelcome to icliniq.com.\nThanks for your query. \nYou have very uncontrolled diabetes. Your lipids are also very high. That means you are not controlling your sugar. Treating diabetes is not just bring sugar numbers down but avoiding complications that are associated with diabetes. It can affect the heart, kidneys, eyes, nerves, brain, and everything. First of all, you need to stop bread, rice, pasta, and potatoes. Eat fewer fruits, especially mango, banana, and grapes. Do not add sugar in tea, no sugary juices, ice cream, or chocolates. Exercise at least 40 minutes daily, even if it is just a walk. If you do not change the lifestyle, no medication can control your sugar. With time, your body can be then affected with diabetes. It is a dietary disease, and treatment is with diet only. The medication can only help when you change your lifestyle. If your planning to get pregnant, you need to be on insulin, and you need to have HBA1c less than 6.5. I do not think you are taking good drugs right now either. These will increase your weight, and that will lead you to have more sugar. Did you try Glucophage (Metformin) before? If yes, why did you stop? Did you try Sitagliptin? Jardiance (Empagliflozin) is a good drug as well. So, in my opinion, you should be on insulin in the present situation if you want to be pregnant especially.

But, you have to understand that it has its disadvantages.\nIf you are comfortable with the administration of injections daily, then definitely you can ask your doctor to shift you on Insulin.\nBut, Insulin also leads to instant hypoglycemia. So,\u00a0you must have meals at the proper times and adequately.

You can definitely continue with what your doctor has suggested.\nI prefer treating my patients with newer drugs, which have proved more potential and efficient, at least in my practice.\nAlso, I would like you to get a blood test called HbA1c done.

But, there are other medications that do not lead to weight loss, so, you can definitely ask your physician to shift you to such medication.\nAlso, just like all medications have side effects, long term studies in patients taking oral anti-diabetic medications, have shown deteriorated kidney function.\nMany people are not compliant in keeping up with daily injections of Insulin, also the risk of hypoglycemia is higher with insulin. Hence, not many people prefer it. If you feel you can cope up with it, please speak to your local physician or diabetologist. They would make a chart depending on your daily sugar levels, as to how much units of insulin would you require. Also, they would educate you regarding rotation of sites, for taking the insulin injections, how and when to take them.\nAlso, don't forget to ask your physician to explain the symptoms of hypoglycemia and also to tell you, when exactly should you be taking the insulin injections (before food, during food, morning or night basal dose) depending on its duration of action.\nI hope this helps.

Also, you should know that exercising and diet restrictions have an important role in maintaining your blood sugars and you should follow them religiously.\nThere are two reasons to develop diabetes. One, because of pancreas not secreting enough insulin and two, our body tissues becoming non-responsive to the circulating insulin, because of a sedentary exercise less high-calorie diet that we follow for years together. That is why exercise is seen to improve insulin action in many patients and has helped us to keep the dosage to a bare minimum.

That will prevent absorption of glucose from the food we eat.\nWhat measures are you taking to control your diabetes? Are you on strict diet for diabetes and doing regular exercises?\nAs you are overweight,\u00a0it will cause less effectiveness of tablets\u00a0you take.

According to the results, we can slowly increase or decrease the dose.\n\n\nAlthough there is an option of starting tablet Metformin, since your creatinine is a bit on the upper normal, it is not recommended.

In the meantime, try to take a low-carbohydrate and low-fat diet. Drink 8 to 10 glasses of water daily. Try to walk 30 minutes daily.\n\n\nSince you have high cholesterol levels, I suggest that you try tablet Simvastatin 20 mg at bedtime daily for six months. We will repeat your lipid profile after three months again.\n\nDo let me know if you need assistance or if you do not understand anything. Hope you find my advice of some benefit.

They start with one drug, then two drugs, then multiple combinations, finally nothing will work and we have start Insulin.\n\n\nEven after taking Insulin for some patients, control cannot be achieved. It is because for the first set of patients, diagnosis was early and some of their pancreatic function can be retained.

He has had recurrent urinary tract infections in the past three months, and every time the culture shows up, some bacteria, I guess, E Coli. He also strains while passing urine and has weak power (stream). He has also already taken Nitrofurantoin, Augmentin duo, and Levobact 750 mg, but the recent culture still shows E coli. He has had high blood pressure and diabetes for the past 20 years, but well-maintained fasting blood sugar is usually between 80- 100 mg/dL, and BP is usually between 120- 130 mm Hg. He does not have a burning sensation while urinating, fever, pain in the back and has never seen blood in the urine. He is currently taking Urimax 0.4, Telma AT, Amlong 5 mg, and Glucomet tablets. Our doctor said there can be some blockage or obstruction and has suggested some tests like PSA and CT Urography. Please go through the attached reports and please clear our doubts, \n1) Why is he always having infections and RBC in his urine?\n2) Why is it not going away after taking powerful and costly antibiotics?\n3) How to treat early renal parenchymal disease as seen on Ultrasound?\n4) He has albumin 80, creatinine 50, and Serum creatinine is 1.2 in urine.

        "a_text": "\n#\nHi,\nWelcome to icliniq.com.\nI will answer the point of your question by point.\n1) Why is he always having infections and RBC (red blood cells) in urine?\nIt always means whenever he is having UTI (urinary tract infection), pus cells and RBC are bound to come.\n2) Why is it not going away after taking powerful and costly antibiotics?\nSometimes the organism is resistant to oral antibiotics, so we have to switch to injectables. Moreover, sometimes antibiotics have to be taken for an extended period, say three months.\n3) How to treat early renal parenchymal disease as seen on ultrasound?\nBy strict control of diabetes or hypertension as well as proper UTI treatment.\n4) He has albumin of 80 mg/dL, creatinine of 50 mg/dL, and serum creatinine is 1.2 mg/dL in urine. What does it signify, and how to treat it?\nAlbumin can occur in UTIs and diabetics. Once it gets settled, albumin should also get corrected. Sometimes even very good control of diabetes albumin can come. Urine and serum creatinine levels are normal\n5) Should we also do PSA (prostate-specific antigen) and CTU (computed tomography urogram) as they are costly tests?\nI think you should have these tests done as all pathologies can not be picked in ultrasound. 6) What treatment do you advise? If there is a recurrent UTI, I will further investigate him based on CT (computed tomography) and switch to an injectable plus oral antibiotics combination.

        "a_text": "\n#\nHello,Welcome to icliniq.comI understand your concern.Thanks for the query.I have read the details given. Fasting glucose of 140 mg/dL is relatively high. Ideally, at your age, the values should be-1. Fasting blood sugar should be less than 100 mg/dL.2. Postprandial sugar should be 150 mg/dL to 160 mg/dL.3. Average blood glucose (sugar) levels (HbA1c) percentage should be less than 6.5 %.At these values, diabetes is considered as well controlled. I have the following concerns-1. If you initially took Glimepiride 2 mg, why did you shift to a 1 mg dose? Because it is possible that a 1 mg dose is not adequate for you. 2. Another important aspect is looking at your height and weight. With a BMI (Body Mass Index) of 26.98 kg/sq meter, you have over 13 kgs of weight (your ideal body weight should be about 82 kgs). Being overweight also affects blood glucose control.3. Another aspect is to give a closer look at your diet. There is a need to have a restricted diet that provides all the necessary nutrients plus adequate calories because your caloric need has to be based on your ideal body weight (82 kg X 20 calories = 1640 calories).Weight reduction and diet control will help in better glucose control.

        "a_text": "\n#\nHello,\nWelcome to icliniq.com.\nI have read your concern in detail and will surely help you out.\nDiabetes generally worsens with time, no matter how hard you control the sugar intake. This is not in your control. What you can control is the number of medicines required to control your diabetes. If you are fit, exercise enough, and consume less sugar, then less number of medicines are required. For those who do not have control over their lifestyle, then more medicines are required. So kindly, do not stress about your blood sugar levels as the levels are good enough. These levels can be controlled with just one medicine of low dose. I suggest you take tablet Metformin 500 mg once a day (consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him/her and take the medicines with their consent). This medicine is enough to control the sugar for the next ten years. So do not think medicines are bad. Just one medicine per day will do good for you.\nTrust me, and you do not have any other autoimmune diseases. Also, the medicines taken for ankylosing spondylitis tend to increase blood sugar levels. Now, as we cannot stop the medicines for ankylosing spondylitis, it is a better solution to start a medicine for diabetes. I hope I have solved your query and hope this helps.

She does not want to increase Novolin units. Would you recommend using inhaled insulin (freeze) in addition to Novolin 70/30 to control post-meal hike of blood-sugar levels? Can these two insulins be used together without adverse effects? Would inhaled insulin also be a solution for the dawn phenomenon? Please help.\nThank you.\n",
        "a_text": "\n#\nHi,\nWelcome to icliniq.com.\nI suggest glucose monitoring while starting and titrating the dose up. Maybe start with a lower dose like 1 mg, see the response, and slowly titrate up. Tablet Repaglinide can be used at lunch to control post-lunch spikes in glucose. Yes, Afrezza (regular insulin inhalation powder) can be used to control the post-meal spikes. Quick in and out is perfect for this to be combined with other insulin. It is hard to say. Before suggesting, I would like to see the glucose profile like pre-dinner, post-dinner, or CGM (continuous glucose monitoring). If you want to take Afrezza in the morning, you need to check glucose before using it and then use it if higher than a specific value, say 180 mg/dL. CGM will be helpful in these situations. Why not switch from Novolin 70/30 to basal-bolus insulin-like Tresiba (Insulin degludec) one daily and Fiasp (Insulin aspart) three times daily? What is her most recent HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin)? What is her individualized glycemic goal? Any comorbidities like kidney or heart disease? Any Insulin issues in switching to the basal-bolus regimen? Please follow up with the above to guide you better.\nThank you. ",

She also takes medicine for high blood pressure. Would she be a candidate for surgery? Do you believe the surgery would be survivable for her?\n",
        "a_text": "\n#\nHi,\nWelcome to icliniq.com.\nIt is a complex situation, and more information would be required for further advice. Most important of how is the patient's condition now and comprehensive knowledge of her stress-bearing capacity and accurate imaging reports of the aortic dissection and other diseases. The outcome of surgery would depend on some factors. I can give you some information that I think can help your question, but it is not a replacement for an in-person evaluation. A diabetic patient of 90 years old is usually a terrible situation for most surgical operations under general anesthesia, but that is not always true. If the patient has no other problem, very fit, active person with well-controlled diabetes, then non-emergency surgery is not always an out-of-the-scope thing. This reluctance does not apply in emergencies where there is an imminent threat to life because of the problem. Age decreases our capacity to bear stress. And vascular surgery is a very high-stress event. And has a high risk of demise in patients who have heart disease and diabetes. In such patients, open surgery has up to 10 to 20 times the odds of death after surgery compared to less than 60 years without any diseases. Another critical factor is the type of aortic dissection (your doctor would know) and whether it can be fixed with some non-surgical options like endovascular repair. It is an experimental trial and can be done only in selected cases. At this age, even if the person undergoing surgery survives the initial surgery, it might take a very long time to get back to a normal quality of life, sometimes even up to a year. At the same time, aortic dissection is a very high-priority emergency for the patient to survive. So, it is a highly complex situation. \nKindly discuss with your cardiothoracic and vascular surgeon with the investigation reports of the patient.Was this answer helpful?\u00a0|\u00a0Same symptoms doesn\u2019t mean you have the same problem.

If the diagnosis of PCOS (polycystic ovaries syndrome) is correct, she may require medicines to make her periods regular.\nPCOS girls are at a risk of obesity, diabetes, hypertension and endometrial hyperplasia. Many of those can be prevented by a good diet, regular exercise, preventing weight gain and taking progesterone tablets to induce a period, if they are irregular even after the age of 20.\nRegarding diet, there is no specific suggestion, but the consumption of fats and refined sugar should be cut down, and fiber intake increased. The calorie intake should be proportional to the calorie expenditure. In general, if she is following the diet and not gaining weight, it would suffice.\nRegular sweat-inducing exercise for at least 45 minutes is a must to avoid all the mentioned complications. Exercise is necessary even when she is not overweight.\nRegarding pregnancy, there is no need to worry, she can conceive easily with medications, if her periods remain irregular despite following the diet restrictions and exercise.

It is unfortunate he developed but it does not mean it is the end for him. As long as he takes his medications, does his routine laboratory workups and checks with his physician then there is nothing much to worry about.\nHe must be informed that as long as he consults with his physician regularly then there will always be an expert making sure he is doing alright and making sure that no complications will develop because of the disease.\nIf the pandemic is causing more worries, it is normal. He might be aware that his condition puts him at a disadvantage compared to a normal healthy individual. But as long as he adheres to social distancing, proper handwashing techniques, precautionary measures such as wearing masks and PPEs (personal protective equipment), if needed, then there is a low risk he might acquire the disease. Remember, diabetes and COVID-19 both are preventable diseases. He needs to take care of himself properly and to do this is by following his doctor's orders and guidelines during the pandemic.\nHowever, I am worried about the declared respiratory rate of 86 (normal is at 18-22). Does he smoke? Any cough or colds? Previous hospitalizations? At this rate, it is best to bring him to the ER for further evaluation. When counting for the respiratory rate it is the one cycle of the rise and fall of the chest. So 1 respiratory rate is equivalent to 1 rise and 1 fall of the chest. ",

The brachiocephalic fistula is an upper arm fistula created by connecting the side of a brachial artery to the end of a cephalic vein or slightly central to the level of the elbow. Finally, the brachial artery\u2013to\u2013transposed basilic vein (BTB) fistula is another upper arm fistula. This fistula is created by anastomosing the side of a brachial artery to the end of a basilic vein that has been transposed laterally and elevated superficially to make it amenable to dialysis cannulation. Other sites could be leg also.\nI advise you to discuss it with your doctor. The patient requires dialysis for sure or you can put a central line and replace it every 15 to 20 days. But AV fistula is the best option.Was this answer helpful?\u00a0|\u00a0Same symptoms doesn\u2019t mean you have the same problem.

Metformin controls her sugar well, but side effects are very severe with diarrhea (10-15 times a day), especially after using this medicine for few days to few weeks on high doses of 1000mg morning and evening.\nCurrent diabetic medication are,\nLantus 48 IU daily at 9 PM, and Humalog Lispro 20 IU three times per day.\nPlease suggest what is the best way to go forward. Can a dose of Insulin be increased further? What are the maximum recommended doses for Insulin, both short and long term? What happens as her age increases? Would the dose of Insulin increase even further?\nPlease help; I can provide any more information you need.\nThanks.\n",
        "a_text": "\n#\nHi,\nWelcome to icliniq.com.\nThanks for your query. I would initially like to know her TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) levels since my target is to maintain TSH to around 1.0. Further, your wife's Insulin is resistant, whereby her dose of Insulin is likely to go up with time. Insulin dose and age do not correlate. The correlation is between the number of carbohydrates (sugars in different forms) in each meal and Insulin dose. The more the carbohydrate content in the food, the more is the Insulin requirement. Reduction of carbohydrates (such as rice, potato, sweets, cold drinks, junk food, confectionery, etc.) will automatically reduce the dose of Insulin. Stop restaurant food completely. Dietary discipline is a must. For the time being, increase the night dose of Humalog Insulin to 22 units and keep on increasing the night dose by two units until your wife's fasting sugar comes down to around 100mg/dL. The morning dose of Lispro may be increased to 21 units and keep on increasing the morning dose by two units after that, till her PP (postprandial) comes down to around 130mg/dL, no change in afternoon dose or that of Lantus (Insulin Glargine). Finally, there is no maximum recommended dose of Insulin. I hope you find my response helpful, informative, and enlightening. ",

Usually, uncontrolled blood sugars may not initially show symptoms, that does not mean it is safe to have high blood sugars for a long time. We are controlling sugars to prevent complications which are usually manifested 5-10 years later.\nIn your case, the blood sugars might have slightly lowered after stopping drinks that might be causing relative hypoglycemia symptoms, which usually will be over within a couple of weeks. Anyway, still your blood sugars are uncontrolled. I will advise you to follow a better diet pattern with limited calories according to your activities and a low glycemic index food intake. Also, try to spend 30 minutes daily for regular aerobic exercises.\nComing to your medication, do not increase Trajenta 5 (Linagliptin). Continue the same dosage. You can add a new tablet for better sugar control. Avoid drinks completely for avoiding sugar fluctuations.Investigations to be done:HBA1c (glycated hemoglobin),serum creatinine, and urine albumin creatinine ratio.Treatment plan:Continue Trajenta 5 mg 0-0-1.

Instead of regular rice, this can be substituted. The presence of fibroids in the uterus has no direct impact on either precipitating or increasing diabetes. Fibroids can cause problems related to the uterus itself. If there are many and fairly big ones, better to get a hysterectomy (removal of the uterus) done. The best judge for this is your gynecologist who can assess the situation better. Follow that advice. As regards blood glucose control, ideally fasting glucose should be less than 100 mg or closer to 100 mg, PP 150 to 170 mg and HbA1c % less than 6.8 %.

Gluconorm-VG2 is prescribed for diabetes, but Telesta 40 is for high blood pressure.

        "q_text": "\nHello doctor,\nMy doctor whom I had been visiting discontinued her practice. I found a new doctor with whom I am having problems. The doctor diagnosed me with diabetes 24 years ago when I was 39. I was tried on a couple of different types and dosages of pills, but I cannot remember the names and was eventually placed on insulin. Currently, on Lantus and NovoLog. I asked her several times which type I have and she said it was type 1. She got me through a pregnancy at age of 39 and also approximately five years ago I was hospitalized with ketoacidosis. Shortly after my pregnancy, I was diagnosed and treated for Graves disease and I am currently on Synthroid. After having to select a different doctor, he said I could not possibly be type 1 since I was 39 and that I was type 2. He wanted me to stop insulin and try Metformin. I said no to stopping insulin but would add Metformin if he wanted to see what it would do. I took it for one month but I could not tolerate it due to GI issues and refused to continue it. My last A1c was 7.2 one month ago but frankly, I thought it would be higher since the last six months dealing with my mother's Alzheimers and getting her into a nursing home and father getting sick and dying recently and dealing with Medicaid insurance issues with both parents. Things are now beginning to settle down. A1c prior to this last one, six months prior was 6.7. I looked at my lab report in the electronic medical record and am concerned about my kidney function. He told me last year that my kidneys looked fine but the labs show a GFR of 57.51. A repeat GFR in six months was 59.41. He has not mentioned kidney function since. Is not this indicative of chronic kidney disease stage 3? What should I do about it? The previous doctor did put me on Enalapril Maleate, not for hypertension but to help the kidneys. He keeps wanting to stop it since my blood pressure is 90/60. It has always been that as long as I remember.\nI am also having trouble with not knowing when I am hypoglycemic. It gets down to about 35 before I notice anything. I told him but he did not seem too concerned one way or the other.

        "a_text": "\n#\nHello,Welcome to icliniq.com.Let us go step wise just like your concerns.The best way for avoiding lumps, bumps, and pain due to repeated Insulin injections is by learning the proper technique for injecting yourself. Please meet a local doctor to learn the same.Also, keep changing the injection sites. You can inject yourself on your hands and thighs as well, after you have used up the area of your abdomen.Morning hypoglycemia means the dosage of Insulin you are taking is exceeding your blood glucose levels. Again, meet a local doctor, who will help you adjust your dosage according to your blood glucose levels so that you do not experience the hypoglycemia attacks.In case you are responding well to Metformin, the Insulin dosage can be lowered as the dosage of Metformin is gradually increased, again in correspondence with your blood glucose levels.I will advise you to buy a glucometer, and then once your doctor educates you on how to adjust your dosages, you can do it yourself.Food is the most common source of glucose. But, also are sweetened fruit juices, cakes, pastries, chocolates, energy drinks, aerated drinks,\u00a0and alcohol. You will have to analyse by yourself, what you consume in excess and can then avoid the same accordingly.Medications are just supportive treatment for diabetes. You must understand that exercise will help your body to utilize glucose, increase insulin secretion and also decrease insulin resistance. This will help you reduce or get off Insulin and maybe lead a more normal life.For further doubts consult a diabetologist online --> https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/diabetologistWas this answer helpful?\u00a0|\u00a0Same symptoms doesn\u2019t mean you have the same problem.

No sugary juices. No bread, rice foods, and potatoes if you cannot stop, at least take as little as possible. Take more vegetables, salads, and fibers. Take fruits only as a sweet dish. For example, do not take mango grapes and bananas. Apple not more than one piece. Strawberries and other berries are fine, along with peach apricot and small amounts of plums.\n2) Intermittent fasting will also help you to control your diabetes. You can fast for 16 hours, like taking your dinner at 7 PM and not eating anything after that, till you take breakfast at 11 AM. During fasting, drink water and green tea without sugar. You can extend fasting to 24 hours then 36 hours as your body adopts. You can do fasting two times a week, or as you feel comfortable, it will control your sugar.\n3) Drink more water.\n4) Sleep well.\n5) Do exercise. At least walk for 30 to 40 minutes daily.\nThe more you will practice these things; the better will be your control.\nCheck your sugar frequently. Your fasting target should be 90 to 130 mg/dl. Two hours after eating, it should be 150 to 160 mg/dl. HbA1c should be less than 7%.\nThank you.Was this answer helpful?\u00a0|\u00a0Same symptoms doesn\u2019t mean you have the same problem.

I want to give some more details about my family. My father was married to his own elder sister's daughter. We are three children to our parents. My elder sister has less IQ and is suffering from fits. She is taking tablets for the past 15 years, and my younger brother has diabetes and is physically challenged.\n",
        "a_text": "\n#\nHi,\nWelcome to icliniq.com.\nThanks for the query. I have seen the details (attachments removed to protect the patient's identity). I want to provide you with some facts regarding diabetes.\n\nType 2 diabetes mellitus is a familial disorder. That means if either of the parents or both have it, then the chances of their children getting it will increase by 75 percent when both the parents have diabetes and by 50 percent if one is so. Fortunately, type 2 diabetes is a preventable condition. If one adopts a modified lifestyle, maintain near average body weight and BMI (body mass index) of 23 kg/m2. In your case, at present, it is 28.46 kg/m2. Your ideal body weight should be about 65 kg, but you have an excess of 15 kg.\nRegular exercise daily for over one hour is a must. That helps maintain body weight (or even reduce) and also allows insulin to work better. \nFood intake has to be regulated. Your daily calorie intake should be based on your ideal body weight. So for you, 65 X20 = 1300 Kcalories a day will be perfect.\nAvoid sweets, deep-fried foods, junk foods, too much cheese, bakery items, and food made of maida. Avoid aerated cool drinks and packaged fruit juices and juices in general.\nIncrease the intake of green leafy vegetables, salads, and fruits daily.\nRefrain from alcohol and smoking.\n\nThese things will help you to prevent diabetes in the near future or even for life. Please check your HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin) level and lipid profile.\nRegarding problems with your sister and brother, these are some of the consequences seen in consanguineous marriages. So it is always advised not to marry within close relations. The genetic defects tend to get compounded. Regarding your fiance's sister having type 1 diabetes, it is unlikely that your fiance may also develop the same. Type 1 diabetes is usually detected at a significantly younger age itself. Very rarely, it may be seen in the latter half of life. The chances are almost nil. But if you do not exercise and take the necessary care as suggested, you would be getting type 2 diabetes with a distinct possibility. So please see that you bring down your weight. Your waist circumference should be 85 cm, a sign of average body weight and shape. I hope I have answered all the queries that you had raised. If you still have any doubts, please do come back. Thanks. ",

This is because the pancreas produces a lesser and lesser amount of insulin on their own. As that happens, the need for insulin will keep climbing.\nThere are two chief things you can do to decrease the insulin need. One is to reduce your diet and calory intake. The second is to maintain your weight. I will need your exact height and weight to be able to calculate the calory intake. Also, you are on dialysis. I would suggest you talk to your nephrologist regarding the type of cleansing fluid used in the machine. This is the fluid that collects your body wastes in it.

        "a_text": "\n#\nHello,\nWelcome to icliniq.com.\nDiabetic enteropathy is not diagnosed after a single episode of diarrhea. Usually, it is chronic and intermittent with regular bowel movements in between. Constipation can also be present. Diarrhea can occur during the night. There are other causes for acute diarrhea-most commonly infections, food poisoning, or adverse reactions to medications. I suggest you wait and see how this whole thing pans out. As long as there is no blood in the feces and no abdominal pain or fever, I would not worry about some serious underlying condition.\nTighter control using insulin is possible but can be difficult due to hypoglycemic episodes. However, if you cut down on carbohydrates and reduce the dose of insulin appropriately, you can achieve lower HbA1c levels with fewer hypoglycemic episodes. I suggest you go through these articles about this.\nAlso, if you can afford or if your insurance covers it, try getting a CGM (continuous glucose monitor). I hope this helps.

The best is always an Insulin pump, but it is costly and requires continued patient education.\nInjecting Insulin into the same site will cause damage to the fat tissue which results in necrosis (cell death). Because of the fat damage, hard bump forms.\nNew inhalation Insulin is not yet come into usage in full fledges. Also, I have not put any of my patients yet on inhaled Insulin, so cannot comment. But yes, initially it has to be supplemented with subcutaneous Insulin as dosing and efficacy is not completely established for Inhaled Insulin.\nIslet cell transplant is recommended for patients of type 1 diabetes who are difficult to control on Insulin (by any method). If the transplant is considered for only diabetes purpose then only islet cell transplant is sufficient.\nThe pancreas has other functions like digestion. If the digestion system gets impaired in a patient who is requiring islet cell transplant, in such a patient'sentire pancreas transplant would be helpful. Well, if no immunosuppressant is used post-transplant, these autoantibodies can destroy the newly transplanted pancreas also.Was this answer helpful?\u00a0|\u00a0Same symptoms doesn\u2019t mean you have the same problem.

How long has your dad been using Trulicity?\nTrulicity is usually started at 0.75 mg weekly, and after four to six weeks, it is increased to 1.5 mg.

        "a_text": "\n#\nHello,\nWelcome to icliniq.com.\nPlease provide me with more details. Have you taken any treatment?\nIt is common to have a progressive reduction in sexual desire with age. Type 2 diabetes is also associated with a decrease in libido. If your blood sugar levels are normal, then there is no need to get worried. For proper sugar control, levels of HbA1c (Glycated hemoglobin A1c) should be checked. HbA1c levels tell about prolonged control of sugar. Suppose the levels are normal, then no need to get worried. For poor erection and libido, drugs like Sildenafil or Tadalafil can be used. Tadalafil in a dose of 5-10 mg per day and 20 mg on an SOS basis helps improve the long-term libido and make a firm erection. Herbal medicines like Tentex Forte (Ashwagandha) help to strengthen the erection. The drug should be taken two tablets twice a day and helps make a strong erection and increase libido in the long run. The drug should be taken for at least 6-12 weeks.\nI hope this helps you, and this will help to improve your libido.\nThanks.Was this answer helpful?\u00a0|\u00a0Same symptoms doesn\u2019t mean you have the same problem.

There are different reasons for this like, and it can be associated with endometriosis, infectious cause, sometimes due to hormonal imbalance. To know the exact cause, ultrasound of the lower abdomen needs to be done. Also, there are some blood tests that need to be done to rule out any malignant cause.\nAs it has been just six weeks, it cannot be called chronic pain. I suggest seeking a gynecologist's help in person is better. A physical examination is necessary before proceeding with further tests. Initially, if the pain subsides with painkillers prescribed by your doctor, then there is no reason to worry much. Recurring pain even after treatment should be carefully managed. So regular follow-ups are advised. Pandemic is there but taking appropriate measures like wearing a mask while visiting your doctor and use of sanitizer whenever needed can help you from the infection.

Two days back, he had breathing issues and his sugar was very low as per the doctors. We hospitalized him in the same hospital and now they are saying that my father is having a\u00a0lung infection. My father is having type 2 diabetes for the past six to seven years. Now the doctors are saying that his Hb is very low at 8.5 and there is a\u00a0presence of creatinine traces in blood along with kidney issues. I have attached his discharge reports.

        "q_text": "\nHello doctor,\nI have developed type-2 diabetes in the past three years. However, in the last year, I did not require insulin as my sugar levels were normal. I live abroad, and I am on Metformin. Due to COVID-19 and various lockdowns in the country, my sugar levels were out of control. I am now back to my strict diet, exercise and still taking Metformin 500 mg twice a day. My morning sugar levels are normal, anywhere between 90 and 133. A test again before lunch very rarely shows high sugar levels. I may need to use my Novolin N injection. If not during lunch, I may have to use 30 minutes before my evening meal. I noticed my eyes are going blurry, and hard to see if my sugar levels rise above 150. A few months back, the retina in my right eye ripped, and I had to do a laser repaired. Then the same thing occurred in my left eye. The doctors here did not know to look at the correlation between that, and diabetes neither did I. When testing my blood sugar from Monday through Sunday before each meal, I usually have an average between 90 to 150. I say if it goes above that, then I take 3 to 5 units of insulin. However, last week before dinner, it pushed up to 248, and I had to take 10 units to get it down. I eat no sugar. I watch my carbs, primarily fruits and vegetables, doing everything I can. The doctor here in this country says that he would like to switch me over to the insulin pen, which is considered a 70/30 distribution.\nMy question is, do you recommend this insulin pen, even though I have days that my sugar may otherwise in the morning be acceptable? Right now, this doctor here in this country is asking me not to take any Metformin or insulin for one week. He wants to see all of my sugar numbers every morning and afternoon so that he can see the pattern of my sugar. Would you follow the same treatment?\n",
        "a_text": "\n#\nHi,\nWelcome to icliniq.com.\nDiabetes has many complications, so it is not just to bring down the numbers but to monitor and treat complications associated with diabetes. Check your eyes for retinopathy, kidneys with urine albumin creatinine ratio, and check your feet.\nLifestyle modifications are the best treatment for diabetes. Take a low carbohydrates diet and no added sugar. No sugary juices, bread, rice, pasta, and potatoes. If you cannot stop, at least take as little as possible. Take more vegetables, salads, and fibers. Consume fruits only as a sweet dish. Do not take mango, grapes, and banana. Do not take apple not more than one piece. Strawberries and other berries are fine to take along with peach, apricot, and small amounts of plums.\nIntermittent fasting will also help you to control your diabetes. You can fast for 16 hours, like taking your dinner at 7 pm and not eating anything after that. Next, you can take breakfast at 11 am. During fasting, drink water and green tea without sugar. You can extend fasting to 24 hours then 36 hours as your body adopts. You can do fasting two times a week, or as you feel comfortable, it will control your sugar.\nDrink more water. Sleep well. Do exercise at least walk 30-40 minutes daily. The more you practice these things, the better will be your control. Check your sugar frequently. Your fasting target should be 90-130. Two hours after eating, it should be 150-160. HbA1c should be less than 7. These targets can vary in individual patient depending upon his diabetes duration and other relevant issues.\nIn my opinion, it is not a good idea to take insulin after you find out that your sugar is high and then bring it down fast. It creates big fluctuations in your sugar levels, meaning one time it is high, and after a few minutes it is down. This is not good. Actually you should check your sugar more frequently one in the morning before breakfast if it is in the range as I above mentioned no need to take any insulin. Then check your sugar before lunch, and the same rule applies and check it after eating as well. I mean that if your sugars are higher after eating only, you should start taking insulin just before meals, like 15-20 minutes before eating, so there should not be a surge in level. How much should you take? That depends on two things: one how much is your sugar before eating and how much carbohydrates are you going to eat. But before considering to bring down your sugars after eating, first bring in control the fasting sugars. Better is to take basal insulin-like Glargine, which comes in the trade name of Lantus at night. You can start it like six units and then increase every day 1-2 units if your fasting sugars are higher than 120-130.\nIf your fasting is in range, then no need. If it goes less than 70, then decrease about 3/4 units the next day. Once your fasting sugar is in range, then we concentrate on after eating sugar. That should be near 150. You can start to take Novo rapid only at your main meal and take it just before meal if you find after eating sugars are higher than range. Your HbA1c should be less than 7. Another important issue is if you have any of the diabetes complications other than eyes as you mentioned.\nYou should check urine albumin creatinine ration at least one a year to check how your kidneys are doing. Do you have any heart issues? How about ur blood pressure and cholesterol levels? It is not just to bring sugar number down but to keep the whole body healthy, as I mentioned above. Check your diet and lifestyle modifications as above. Low carbohydrate diet and intermittent fasting, as I mentioned above, will help you a lot. If you could practice it well, I hope you may not even need insulin, and your Metformin will be enough. ",

        "a_text": "\n#\nHello,\nWelcome to icliniq.com.\nI am very sorry to say that the present blood glucose values you have mentioned indicate your glycemic control is not good. In pregnancy, there is a requirement of strict blood sugars control as it can affect the baby's growth and well-being. The ideal fasting should be less than 95, and post-meal should be below 120 (two hours post meals). Poor sugar control can make the baby's size increase more than normal, which can pose difficulty in delivery, which can be risky to both the baby and the mother. Also, poor sugar control can pose a risk of sudden intrauterine deaths. So it is highly essential to have good sugar control. Please consult with your diabetologist or endocrinologist and review with your sugar values so that your Insulin dose can be modified based on your blood sugar profile. You will need a combination of different types (long and short-acting types) based on your sugar profile. Also, be in touch with your gynaecologist for monitoring your baby's well-being (using NST (non-stress test) and ultrasounds).\n- Do walking for at least 20 to 30 minutes in the morning and evening.\n- Follow your diabetic diet very strictly till delivery.\n- Keep a check on fetal movements; you can chart daily the fetal movements counts (check for an hour after three major meals by lying on the side and counting the number of actions in that one hour. The total of all three hours should be ten or more). Report to your doctor if you perceive any reduced movements.\nI hope this information helps you. Please take reasonable care and consult your caregivers (diabetologist and obstetrician) for better outcomes of pregnancy.Was this answer helpful?\u00a0|\u00a0Same symptoms doesn\u2019t mean you have the same problem.

Diet control is another essential factor in this case. You must cut down on sweets, sugar, fried, excessive oils, fat, etc. Consume a simple nutritional healthy balanced diet. Drink plenty of water, especially when you get up in the morning, drinking at least two glasses of water should be considered. Make sure you start to exercise, maybe walk, or yoga, etc., gradually.

The present complaints you have mentioned after starting insulin, may not be actually related to insulin rather may be due to uncontrolled diabetes or else a systemic disease most probably involving liver in view of jaundice. Or even a renal problem can cause the same because he is on pain killers (Ibuprofen) which may effects negatively to kidneys in such patients.\nFirst, stop Ibuprofen at the earliest. Make sure insulin is injected at proper site, rule out insulin site infections. Rule out kidney and liver involvement by doing RFT (renal function test) and LFT (liver function test) along with blood routine. Why insulin was directly started after Metformin is also a doubt? There are many good oral tablets which are stronger than Metformin that may be tried before insulin if no contraindications.The Probable causes:Weight loss may be due to uncontrolled sugars which are signified by blood sugars postmeal.Investigations to be done:Liver function test. Renal function test. Complete blood count with ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate). HBA1c (glycated hemoglobin).Treatment plan:Proper diabetic diet. Regular aerobic exercises for 30 minutes per day.

Pain in the fingers of both hands, unable to close fist easily (after sleeping). Sometimes pain in the arms. I need to get diagnosis of pain and long term solution (medications) for sugar.\n",
        "a_text": "\n#\nHello, \nWelcome to icliniq.com.\nI will provide you the outline of management in your case, however, actual changes in treatment regimen should be done after discussing with treating doctor.\nFirstly, your heart looks alright with no evidence of blockages, however, blood pressure is an issue which needs to be taken care of. You are started on Ramipril, but you should check it frequently at home as 2.5 mg alone less likely to completely normalize your BP. So if home BP remains elevated more than 140/90 mmHg after 2.5 mg Ramipril then it has to make twice daily.\nNext regarding sugar, it is not very well controlled especially post meals. Now I do not know whether you were tried initially on any medications or not, if not then medications should be tried. Now, Metformin is a basic and most important medication for it. So, you should discuss with your doctor regarding initiating it. Also, you will need add on drugs as Metformin alone will not be sufficient, which includes Teneliglipitin and Glimepiride which comes in combination of Metformin.\nIf medications are not feasible at the moment, then dose of bolus insulin which is delivered with each meals should be increased by two units, in order to take care of post meals surge. So that you are able to have proper diet.\nAlso, regarding pains, it is likely a neuropathy due to deranged sugars. For that, sugars should be tightly controlled and you will need supplements like Neurobion forte once daily. If this does respond to multivitamin supplements then you will need nerve stabilizers like Pregabalin, etc.\nAlso, your triglycerides level is too much elevated, for that you need to have a healthy lifestyle like avoiding fatty oily foods. Have regular exercises like brisk walking for at least 30 minutes a day. This will also bring your sugar level down. Also, you will need medications here to control triglycerides like tablet Fenofibrate 145 mg bedtime daily for eight weeks.\nThere are some issues and there is good scope for improvement. Also, you should undergo TMT(treadmill test) at regular intervals of three to four years. Also, considering your family history of heart disease, it is better you also undergo CT (computed tomography) coronary angiography once as it has got very high sensitivity and can tell us if even minute blockages and preventive medications can be started.\nI hope this helps.Was this answer helpful?\u00a0|\u00a0Same symptoms doesn\u2019t mean you have the same problem.

These are scientifically proven, very safe and highly effective. They result in long term weight loss in individuals suffering from an excess weight problem, and also lead to long term remission from co-morbid medical conditions such as high BP and sleep apnea.\nBariatric or metabolic surgeries alter hormones which control body fat stores and reset set value for fat storage to a lower level. Same hormonal changes are responsible for remission from problems like diabetes. Depending upon your weight, presence or absence of other medical problems, I choose different surgeries. \nSleeve with bypass combination surgeries is more powerful and durable. ",

Her urine microalbumin is raised which points towards heart and kidney function. She needs to be started on statins after consulting her physician. Kidneys get affected in diabetic patients.

Therefore, it is advised to avoid sugar and carbohydrate for up to 60 minutes at least for proper release and action of insulin as well as for proper action of growth hormone.\nGH has an anti-insulin effect; with years of exposure of growth hormone it may cause earlier expression of type 2 diabetes mellitus condition.\nFor further clarifications consult an internal medicine physician online --> https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/internal-medicine-physicianWas this answer helpful?\u00a0|\u00a0Same symptoms doesn\u2019t mean you have the same problem.

However, if levels drop too low that is less than 70 mg or so, there is a possibility of developing hypoglycemia. So please take care not to have too low levels.\nRegarding what is diabetes and details about it, it is very difficult to explain here. However, some points are being given:\n1. Diabetes is a hormone (insulin) deficiency disease, plus there may be resistance to its action, mainly in fat or overweight person. In some persons both these situations are responsible. Excess weight and physical inactivity are major culprits.\n2. Once diabetes develops, there is a derangement of metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. But the major visible problem is high glucose levels and HbA1c.\n3. This leads to an effect on microvasculature (small blood vessels) supplying retina, kidney, and nerves. Secondly, damage to macrovasculature (large vessels) like coronary arteries supplying the heart and large vessels supplying lower limbs. These actions lead to retinal damage (retinopathy, kidney damage and neuropathy and sexual problems in male). Large vessel damage causes heart-related issues, damage to the blood supply to lower limbs and ulceration at times leading to loss of limbs.\nType 2 diabetes was earlier seen in persons above 40 years. However, nowadays it is seen more often in much younger age group, even in teen age. Strict blood glucose control with fasting less than 100 mg, PP (postprandial) 150 to 160 mg and HbA1c less than 6.8 should be maintained. Apart from taking specific medications, it is essential to take properly planned restricted diet, no sweets, no deep fried foods, no bakery items, no foods made of maida and avoid colas. Increase the intake of green leafy vegetables and salads. Plus regular exercise of over one hour and maintaining a near normal weight are important aspects of the treatment.Was this answer helpful?\u00a0|\u00a0Same symptoms doesn\u2019t mean you have the same problem.

In the hospital, they did CT scan, EEG, ECG and Holter monitoring. Everything was normal. The doctors are not able to find the cause for his blank out. Please advice.\n",
        "a_text": "\n#\nHi,\nWelcome to icliniq.com.\nI want to assure you do not worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case history, reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and can well understand your genuine health concerns.The Probable causes:CT scan shows no significant lesion in brain and no focal hemorrhagic bleeding event which is one of the main causes in many cases. Heart diseases can also cause unconsciousness. In such cases, we monitor indoor patients on Holter monitor for any kind of rhythmic change in heart beat and to see if there is any atrial or ventricular fibrillation. Your father did not have a positive sign there. His heart rhythms are normal.\n\nSometimes there is an imbalance in the serum electrolytes and fluid; electrolytes imbalance may lead to unconsciousness and syncope. But, your father is fine on that too. Your father's angiography for single artery occlusive disease went eventless and normal flow to heart was restored with stent deployment.\n\nMy final impression is:-\nPatients with diabetes also sometimes get unconscious due to the low glucose levels in blood and due to low supply of glucose to the tissues. For example as in case of type II diabetes, they get low insulin levels that cause them to get problems with taking glucose into the tissues from blood.\n\nNo need to worry as this may be anything that is not so obvious and so minor and a single event that is unable to get revealed on investigations.\n\nIn such situations, usually there is no harm to the patient. Patients after angiography may sometimes get such an issue due to manipulation of the heart in angiography. But, this is not a major issue of medical concern. There is no problem with his heart and the stent is not displaced from the site which may be a source of tension for the patient. Your father is totally alright.
